# GetYoutubeComments

Python script to retrieve YouTube comments and likes/dislikes using the YouTube API and the Return YouTube Dislikes API. The data retrieved will be used for sentiment analysis using VADER, textblob and BERT to predict dislikes on a given video, and to generate a comment based engagement metric.

# Reproducing the experiment

I wouldn't recommend repeating the experiment as it will take hours to run. Cells marked with "###---###" should be commented out. They are left uncommented for easier reading.
