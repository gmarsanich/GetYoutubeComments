# GetYoutubeComments

Python script to retrieve YouTube comments and likes/dislikes using the YouTube API and the Return YouTube Dislikes API. The data retrieved will be used for sentiment analysis using VADER, textblob and BERT to predict dislikes on a given video, and to generate a comment based engagement metric.

# Reproducing the experiment

I wouldn't recommend repeating the entire experiment as it will take hours to run. Cells marked with "###---###" should be commented out. They are left uncommented for easier reading. After those cells are commented out, you should be able to run the notebook and see the output as it is on the repo.
