# GetYoutubeComments

Python script to retrieve YouTube comments and likes/dislikes using the YouTube API and the Return YouTube Dislikes API. The data retrieved will be used for sentiment analysis using VADER, textblob and BERT to predict dislikes on a given video, and to generate a comment based engagement metric. Certain cells are commented out to avoid unnecessary API calls and long running code. If you uncomment them, try not to run them.
