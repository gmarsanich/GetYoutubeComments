"""Castle On The Hill""

When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down

I was younger then
Take me back to when

I found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way
You make me feel
And it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night
I don't reckon that I did it right

I was younger then,
Take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
Oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way
You make me feel
And it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way
I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way
You make me feel
And it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

"I actually grew up in this small area of Suffolk and Ed is just a year younger than me. We hung out in the same friendship circles, he was always very pleasant but I can’t say much about him because just a friend of a friend. But this song and this music video literally takes me back to high school and college. Growing up in sleepy Suffolk was dreamlike and Ed’s right, sometimes a little boring. We all craved some excitement. The castle shown and talked about is Framlingham Castle, spend many an evening there drinking huge bottles of cider and smoking roll ups. This song is a spot on the way he talks about it and makes me so nostalgic! I literally recognize every place in the video from when I was the same age as what Ed is describing now. What I was give to go back to that time! I’m really glad he filmed this video around Framlingham ! I can’t describe the feeling watching this. I now live in a different country, but this place is my home",0.9792,Positive,0.06304796081111871,Netural,0.4955487847328186,Positive
"0:23When I was six years old I broke my leg
６歳のころ、足を折ったんだ

 

I was running from my brother and his friends
僕は兄とその友達から逃げていた

 

And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
そして転がり落ちて、芝生の匂いを感じたね

 

I was younger then, take me back to when I
あのときは若かった。戻りたいな

 
[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
恋にも落ちたし、失恋もした

 

Made friends and lost them through the years
友達もできて、失うことも会った

 

And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
あの場所もしばらく見てないな。僕は成長したんだ。わかってる。

 

But I can't wait to go home
でも家に帰るのが待ちきれないよ
 
[Chorus]
I'm on my way
僕はいま帰り道にいる

 

Driving at 90 down those country lanes
あの田舎道を走っている

 

Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
""Tiny Dancer""を歌いながらね

 

And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
君のことが恋しいな。本当に

 

We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
僕たちは丘の上にある城の向こうの夕日を眺めていたんだ

 
[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
15歳になって手作りのタバコを吸ってたな

 

Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
裏でいけないこともやったし、友達と酔っ払ったこともあった

 

Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
金曜日の夜、初めてキスをしたけど、上手にはできなかった

 

But I was younger then, take me back to when
でも、あのときは若かった。戻りたいな
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
恋にも落ちたし、失恋もした

 

Made friends and lost them through the years
友達もできて、失うことも会った

 

And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
あの場所もしばらく見てないな。僕は成長したんだ。わかってる。

 

But I can't wait to go home
でも家に帰るのが待ちきれないよ

We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Over the castle on the hill
あの丘の上にある城の向こうに

 

Over the castle on the hill
あの丘の上にある城の向こうに

 
[Bridge]
One friend left to sell clothes
ある友達は洋服を売るようになった

 

One works down by the coast
ある人は港で働いている

 

One had two kids but lives alone
ある人は二人の子供がいるけど一人で生きてる

 

One's brother overdosed
ある兄貴はラリってる

 

One's already on his second wife
ある人はすでに再婚した

 

One's just barely getting by
ある人はギリギリ生きてる

 

But these people raised me
でもそんな人々に育てられたんだ

 

And I can't wait to go home
だから待ちきれないよ
 
[Chorus]
And I'm on my way, I still remember
僕はいま帰り道にいる。ちゃんと覚えてる

 

These old country lanes
この田舎道を

 

When we did not know the answers
僕たちは答えを知らなかった

 

And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
君が恋しいよ。本当に

 

We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

"I sit and gaze at the setting sun
The ocean bubbling away in the backdrop
A golden silence descending on the earth
Streaks of light blazing from the horizon

Gentle steps announce her coming
Dancing on the waves as they come and go
Lightening up the world as the sun fades
The stars come out to watch her sway

I look over and I see people gather
Her radiance too powerful to ignore
She dances and dances without a care
And like moths we watch and move closer
How often does perfection pass you by

She slows down and she looks over
And then, then our eyes meet
The ocean slows down, The universe sighs
And I feel myself slip
Losing myself in the depths of her eyes

Yg sayang banget sama gw selalu belain gw kasih bantuan ke gw pas didormitory.Banyak lagi ketika gw susah mereka selalu ada karna sebaliknya ketika mereka butuh bantuan gw ,gw bakal berusaha bantu ada sebisa mungkin.Yg bilang gw gak punya teman mereka yg gak kenal gw ..Hidup gw dulu normal berjalan apa adanya , seperti yg lain . Sampai akhirnya gw kenal mereka sama circle nya setan itu ,gw jadi berubah , silahkan tanya kan ke mereka kenapa gw jadi narik diri ,Gak seperti dulu lagi.IYA EMANG GW YANG SALAH .GW WAKTU ITU SALAH MILIH CIRCLE PERTEMANAN YANG AKHIRNYA JADI musibah buat gw sama keluarga gw.Makanya makin kesini gw makin berpikir semua ini kesalahan gw biar aja gw yang nanggung sendiri .Tunggu sampai situasi normal gw sampai bisa nemuin hal yang menarik buat gw .Gw bakal masa bodo cuekin mereka yg mantau gw 24 jam yg nyuri privasi kebebasan gw.Bertahun tahun mereka lakuin itu ke gw, belum lagi mereka selalu ngejebak gw , ngerjain gw gimana cara nya supaya hidup gw hancur , tiap pekerjaan yg gw jalanin ketika gw mulai pahamin pasti diusik mereka gimana caranya supaya gw berhenti kerja sampai sekarang ini juga gitu mereka berusaha buat hancurin usaha kerjaan gw ,ngirim orang mata2 in gw buat ngancurin kerjaan usaha gw yg mereka mau itu bikin hidup gw menderita pelan pelan ,jahat iya emang dari dulu",-0.5883,Negative,-0.05034090909090909,Negative,0.25027963519096375,Netural

"When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I 
Found my heart and broke it here, made friends and lost them through the years
And I’ve not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know, I’ve grown 
but I can’t wait to go home 

I’m on my way, driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, And I miss the way you make me feel, and it’s real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends 
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don’t reckon I did it right
I was younger then, take me back to when we found
Weekend jobs when we got paid and buy cheap spirits and drink them straight 
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we’ve grown
I can’t wait to go home

I’m on my way, driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, And I miss the way you make me feel, it’s real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast 
One had two kids but lives alone
One’s brother overdosed
Ones already on his second wife
Ones just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can’t wait to go home

And I’m on my way, and I still remember those country lanes
When we did not know the answers, And I miss the way you make me feel, it’s real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

"LYRICS 

When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
I know I've grown, but I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and
Getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night
I don't reckon that I did it right, but
I was younger then, take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
Oh, how we've grown, but I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

"We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it
And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give you up)
We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up

"This song NEVER gets old..no matter how many times I listen to it I see all my favourite memories flashing before my eyes. Late nights at an old playground, now destroyed, laughs with people I haven't talked to in years, birthday parties with old classmates..I didn't know I was making memories back then, I thought nothing would change. I guess it did. I don't even remember the last time I played carelessly with my friends until it got dark. I miss it and worse thing is, those years are not coming back. I let them pass and only now I understand I was making memories that will stay with me forever<3 I wish I had figured it out sooner..",0.6281,Positive,-0.05909090909090909,Negative,0.37068384885787964,Positive

"The only Ed Sheeran song I keep coming back to because its about home and my home, in particular. I loved that Ed didn't shy away from making a song about Suffolk and I loved that the castle that I used to visit frequently in my youth is featured prominently. Every time I return to Suffolk to see relatives and old friends, this songs on at full blast. 

Still don't know wtf he's talking about when he mentions mountains because Suffolk's one of the lowest-lying areas of the UK. But I get that its meant to be about nostalgia for home in general. Just can't help but yell ""REPRESENT"" every time, though, because Suffolk is one of those gems of a county that gets so often overlooked in the UK.

I love all the shots in it as well and how they're often places I recognise. The Felixtowe docks, the banger races, those old pubs down by the waterfront and along the coast, abandoned farmhouses, those cold 5th November nights standing around a bonfire with the Guy Fawkes effigy. so many things I remember going to and climbing on in my youth. It probably weird to have this much nostalgia for the good old days when I'm only 20.",0.9032,Positive,0.11414141414141415,Netural,0.5612452626228333,Positive

Other side of death is eternity. Eternity in hell where there is no music but wailing and gnashing of teeth. Or eternity in heaven through Jesus Christ and enjoy heavenly music for free.
