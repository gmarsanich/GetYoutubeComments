You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you
Then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

I remember when I found micheal Jackson my babysitter asked if I ever heard of several artist until she said Michael Jackson and all I said was “yea I’ve heard of him I’m pretty sure he died” now I was lying expecting my babysitter to say “he’s not dead” but she said “yea he died in 2011 or 2010” and I got scared as soon as she played thriller (the extended one that’s like over ten minutes long) I got scared but when I heard the song I was addicted,-0.7269,Negative,0.05714285714285713,Netural,0.32865017652511597,Netural

"Lyrics:

They told him, ""Don't you ever come around here""
""Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear""
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (beat it)
Just beat it (beat it)
Just beat it (beat it)
Just beat it (beat it, uh)
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it
You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you
Then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (beat it, beat it, beat it)
Beat it (beat it, beat it)
Beat it (beat it, beat it)
Beat it (beat it, beat it)
Beat it (beat it, beat it)
Beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right (who's right)
Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated (no one)
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated (oh, no)
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)

"i definitely have something to talk about, even though i was living and raised up in china after i was born in 1999, mjs music still came around my childhood, my memories about it was very blurry, i rarely heard about mjs music before i even knew what was it and who was it, but at least one thing for sure is that i was known about some of 'beat it's melodies when i was 10 year old, but at that time i didnt even know what should i do if i wanna find that song, but it sure was special to me, thats why i kept it in my memories.
im not sure what exactly the year it was but i guess its around 2010 that made me about 11 year old, i was watching videos about a multiplayer mod of a video game called 'vice city', the video creator added 'beat it' as the videos background music, and thats where i got all the information that i needed, the first time in my life that i was known about the songs name, and the legend himself 'michael jackson'.",0.8181,Positive,0.12908163265306122,Netural,0.409279465675354,Positive

"They told him, ""Don't you ever come around here""
""Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear""
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)

Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (beat it)

They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it
You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you
Then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
