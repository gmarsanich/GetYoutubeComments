"::: Lyrics :::

One, two, three, four
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true
It's true, my bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights, and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do

My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true
It's true, my bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true
It's true, my bad habits lead to you

"Romans 10:9-10- If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. 

Accept Jesus into your life today He is loving and everything you need in this life and the life after! He loves you immensely, open up Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John in your Bible and read about Him. Get to know who He is :). John 14:6- Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.""✝️❤ Being a Christian will not always be easy, and does not mean that you won't experience temptation and sin; we are humans after all. Furthermore, we must ask for forgiveness for all of our sins. You may lay your burdens at His feet. Forgiving others for their sins is also very important. 

Jesus said- ""14For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 15But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins."" (Matthew 6:14-15) 

""8If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. 9If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. 10If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us."" (1 John 1:8-10) 

“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."" (Matthew 11:28).
We are cleansed by the blood of Jesus because of His great sacrifice on the cross. 

"" 16For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son."" (John 3:16-18) 

""6If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth. 7But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin."" (1 John 1:6-7) 

If you seek God, you are seeking eternity with Him!
God bless you all, seek Him and you WILL find Him🙏🏾❤",0.9902,Positive,0.26480008417508416,Netural,0.6212024092674255,Positive

Jesus will soon be seen by all men, women, and children in the clouds. Jesus is returning now! Believe and be saved.

John 10:30 (Jesus speaking)
I and my Father are one.

For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, *The everlasting Father,* The Prince of Peace.

Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, *God with us.*

John 1:1 & 14
1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
14 And the Word was made flesh (Lord Jesus), and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.

John 8:24 (Jesus speaking)
I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.

John 14:9 (Jesus speaking)
Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father?

Hebrews 1:1-3, & 8 (God calls His Son ""O God"" because Jesus IS God in the flesh)
1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,
2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;
3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
8 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.

1 John 5:7
For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.

Titus 2:13
Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;

Revelation 1:7
Behold, he cometh with clouds; *and every eye shall see him,* and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.

Isaiah 44:6 (God speaking)
Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.

Revelation 1:8 (Jesus speaking)
I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, *the Almighty.*

Revelation 22:13 (Jesus speaking)
I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.

There Are None Righteous / How To Be Saved

Romans 3:10 & 23
10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

Luke 5:31-32 (Jesus speaking)
31 And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.
32 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

1 Peter 3:18 (The word “quicken” means “to make alive”)
For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:

Romans 10:9
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

Acts 4:12
Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

Ephesians 2:8-9
8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.

Repent of your sins or suffer the consequences. Lord Jesus died in our places personally to take the death punishment that sin deserves and then resurrected by the power of God. Believe this and sincerely repent of your sins each time you sin and you will have eternal life and nothing to fear. Fail to repent and you will end up in the Lake of Fire.",0.991,Positive,0.08703492063492062,Netural,0.7170621156692505,Positive

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do

My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space

I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do                               Je n'ai plus rien à perdre, ou à utiliser, ou à faire
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space              Mes mauvaises habitudes font que les yeux écarquillés regardent dans le vide
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say         Et je sais que je perds le contrôle des choses que je dis
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape         Ouais, je cherchais une issue, maintenant je ne peux plus m'échapper
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true                   Rien ne se passe après deux, c'est vrai, c'est vrai

Every pure intention ends when the good times start           Chaque intention pure se termine quand les bons moments commencent
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark       Tomber sur tout pour atteindre l'étincelle de la première fois
It started under neon lights, and then it all got dark        Cela a commencé sous les néons puis, tout est devenu sombre
I only know how to go too far                                             Je sais seulement comment aller trop loin

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone                Mes mauvaises habitudes mènent à des soirées tardives qui se terminent seules

We took the long way 'round                                   Nous avons fait le tour   
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now                          Et brûlé jusqu'à ce que le plaisir s'épuise, maintenant

"Every time you come around you know I can’t say no 
Every time the sun goes down I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
and tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights ending alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearing this will be the last, but it probably won’t
I’ve got nothing left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was looking for a way out, now I can’t escape 
Nothing happens after two
It’s true it’s true
My bad habits lead to you

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Falling over everything to reach the first times spark
Started under neon lights then it all got dark 
I only know how to go too far 

My bad habits lead to late nights ending alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearing this will be the last, but it probably won’t
I’ve got nothing left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was looking for a way out, now I can’t escape 
Nothing happens after two
It’s true it’s true
My bad habits lead to you

We took the long way round
And burned til the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights ending alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearing this will be the last, but it probably won’t
I’ve got nothing left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say

Reviewing the top 10 on the ARIA chart for 20/04/2022. This is number 5 MUSICALLY That beat is quite driving and the vocals work well. He sings this well. Not too crowded. I love the spaces in this. LYRICALLY The song sounds like it has been constructed a lot better than the previous song Shivers. You can tell that the lyrics fit the song rather than trying to fit some random lyrics into it. It sticks with a theme and doesn't wander off in strange directions. VIDEO Cleverly constructed and makes it memorable. Ed Sheeran's character is well constructed.

"Tutte le volte che arrivi qui, sai che non posso dire di no
Tutte le volte che il sole tramonta, lascio che tu prenda il controllo
Riesco a sentire il paradiso prima che la mia Terra imploda
E stanotte ho avuto qualcosa di bellissimo

Le mie cattive abitudini portano a notti fonde che termino da solo
Conversazioni con uno straniero che conosco a malapena
Giurando che questa sarà l’ultima, ma sicuramente no
Non ho niente da perdere, o da usare, o da fare

Le mie cattive abitudini portano ad occhi spalancati che fissano lo spazio
So che perderò il controllo delle cose che dirò 
Sì, cercavo una via d’uscita, ora non posso fuggire 
Non succede nulla dopo il numero due, è vero, è vero
Le mie cattive abitudini portano a te

Ooh ooh ooh
Le mie cattive abitudini portano a te
Ooh ooh ooh 
Le mie cattive abitudini portano a te

Qualsiasi candido fine termina con l’inizio dei bei momenti
Fallendo tutto per trovare la scintilla del primo momento
È iniziato sotto luci al neon, ed ora tutto è diventato buio
So solamente come spingermi troppo oltre

Le mie cattive abitudini portano a notti fonde che termino da solo
Conversazioni con uno straniero che conosco a malapena
Giurando che questa sarà l’ultima, ma sicuramente no
Non ho niente da perdere, o da usare, o da fare

Le mie cattive abitudini portano ad occhi spalancati che fissano lo spazio

Non succede nulla dopo il numero due, è vero, è vero
Le mie cattive abitudini portano a te 

Ooh ooh ooh
Le mie cattive abitudini portano a te 
Ooh ooh ooh

Abbiamo preso il sentiero più lungo 
E siamo bruciati fino a che la gioia non è scappata, ora

Le mie cattive abitudini portano a notti fonde che termino da solo 
Conversazioni con uno straniero che conosco a malapena 
Giurando che questa sarà l’ultima, ma sicuramente no
