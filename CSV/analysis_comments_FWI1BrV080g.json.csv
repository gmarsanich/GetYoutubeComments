"The only reason that they're able to skyrocket that fast is because they are a company. In fact, YouTube loves companies. It probably costs YouTube a lot to keep Pewdiepie's content on the servers than T-Series, as they're able to pay for that. It sucks that our whole world, golly, even our internet, is being sold to comanies like T-Series, and the worst thing is that people pay no mind. Sometimes I can just imagine what our future is gonna be, and just the thought makes me want to cut my life short.

"I really hope pewdiepie reaches 100M subscribers before Tseries, that will be the proof that indenpendant creators are much more than corporations.. Tseries has a huge advantage (due to the population in India suddenly getting access to the internet) and a lot of financial ressources it is obvious this is not a fairplay battle but still Pewdiepie has been keeping the lead and thats just amazing.
