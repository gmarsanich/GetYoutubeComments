"Le monstre en moi DÉNOUEMENT. -Les X… Ultra…Les ULTRA X….
Le projet lisait elle en lettre illisible.. 
Le Projet MK-X-ULTRA mais qu'est-ce que tout ceci signifie…
-Pourquoi le nom de la famille Jones figure sur cette feuille… Ainsi que le mien et celui de Ryan et de Noah…. Orson Vaillancourt….Mais nous sommes tous sur cette liste …… Mais qui sont toutes ces gens…… dit elle fixant des centaines de photos d'enfant et de bébé trouvant même une photo d'elle à sa graduation l'arrachant en la fixant.
-Mais c'est moi. Dit elle crochetant au passage de sa main un vieux enregistreur qui reculait en recommençant en démarrant sur un message grincheux
- Salut Kate si tu écoutes ceci c'est que je suis probablement hélas mort. Je m'attendais à ce que ce soit toi qui remonte jusqu'au source les plus profondes de mon enquête et la vérité Kate est que notre meurtrier est comme nous des personnes particulièrement spéciales issue de famille qui  on été manipulé génétiquement et formé à devenir des agents spéciales… Mais attention Kates Parce que l'un d'eux à réellement mal virées et l'expérience à tournées aux cauchemars et je ne peux même pas te dire ce qui est arrivé dans cette hôpital psychiatrique mais en faisant des expérience sur c'est gens Kates il ont réveillé une bêtes dans l'un deux.  Il ignore quel monstre il on créé mais il est devenu insaisissable.   

Et croit le ou non mais le seul moyen qu'il on trouver pour attraper ce monstre est d'en créer un autre à sa taille mais de choisir un type doté d'une gentillesse et d'une incapacité totale à faire du mal inutilement. Un être qui se croirait totalement inutile et sans pouvoir et sans force alors que c'est toutes l'inverse de ce qu'il cache en lui.
-Je rêve mais ça me fait penser qu'à une seule personne.
Kate Je pense que j'ai un doute de qui est cette personne dit l'enregistrement en ce terminant.
-Moi aussi Orson mais merci pour les confirmations. Tu n'as jamais été aussi utile que de ton vivant. Pourquoi avoir gardé ce secret tout ce temps?
Chère journal, j'ai l'impression de manquer toute l'essentiel de cette affaire de meurtre dans mon film et d'être un réalisateur amateur écrivai Isxago Xollan dans son journal intime sur une chaise de princesse sur un petit chic balcon au sommet du chateau qui surplombait la ville de la capitale.
Il refermait son livre en regardant la lune rouge et pleine dans le ciel. 
Laissant la porte du haut balcon de la chambre d'hôtel ouverte bouger à peine dans le vent de l'air calme et serein en fermant les lumières pour marcher dans sa grande robe de chambre vers le grand lit baldaquin de sa grande suite.
Ce reposant et couchant dans son lit en s'enveloppant dans une piles de couverture dans le grand lit pleines et remplies d'oreillées. 
Laissant le réalisateur dormir à point fermé en ronflant bruyamment.
Et quelque chose ce gliser et marche doucement dans la chambre de sa silouette noir . Une immense ombre noir qui tenait dans sa main une sorte de longue lame lacéré.  
Ronflant à point fermé et très dure devant les bruits de métal fronter entre c'est lame scintillante sous le clair de la lune qui se reflétait dans les fenêtres de rideau de la chic chambre…   Avant de se planté en hurlant et grognant de bruit de ressort de cette chose horrible qui se débattait contre le lit du réalisateur qui se réveillait en sursaut à côté de James et de Kate Vandale sous les hurlements fixant sur une caméra une chose dans la chambre…
-Alors c'est pour cela que vous m'avez retiré vite fait de ma chambre et de mon sommeil j'avoue que ça surprend…mais je ne comprends toujours rien.
-Mais  pas besoin de ne rien comprendre l'important c'est que vous êtes en vie. disait Kates Vandale en fixant l'écran. Vous pouvez remercier James Jones de nous avoir prévenu.
-Prévenue mais comment ce type aurait pu savoir ce qui arrive. Dit-il alors que coucher sur un lit d'hôpital connecté à toute sorte de machine et de capteur et sensé James Jones transformé à moitié en louo-loup dormait au millieu d'une étrange pièce entouré de médecin en blanc et d'homme en noir.
-Que fait-il il va bien au moins… Disait l'homme en noir regardant un médecin concentré dire.
-Si il va bien il dort et il vient de  faire un rêve qui vient de sauver une  vie. James Jones ne mentait pas en regardant cela…Disait Noah ouvrant un document qui affichait dans sa chambre une chose qui a attaqué le pauvre réalisateur…
-Mais c'est Isxago Xollan le célèbre réalisateur  hurlant l'agent.
-Chut… il va bien grâce à ce rêve Kates Vandales est intervenue sur les lieux et selon elle il c'est passé exactement ce que James à rêver 2 heures plus tôt pendant qu'il était enfermé ici il était connecté à cette chose et semblait voir ce qu'elle voyait.
-Vous savez lorsque il va se réveiller et sera très en colère de ce retrouver dans ce laboratoire. Dit l'agent de sécurité et de protection.
-Vous savez qu'ont vient de sauver une vie et empêché un meurtre.  Ca s'équivaut dans un sens non. 
Alors que entrant armées avec un groupe d'homme et une équipe d'intervention armées dans la chambre d'hôtel Kate Vandale fesait face à une monstrueuse chose dans le noir qui la regardait et ce retournait vers elle..
-Ne bouger plus au nom de la lois je vous arrête et je tire .Disait elle relevant sont armes vers la chose qui se tenait devant la vitrine et le clair de la lune des lumières de chambre qui flashait dans toutes les sens autours.
-M'arrêter essayer donc dit la chose devant elle la laissant tiré la chose de tout sa charge vidant le chargeur de son fusil de balles qui percutaient la chose sans réaction qui rigolait et riait même.
-Vous croyez que ce sera suffisant pour m'arrêter dit il tiré par toute l'équipe tactique courant sous une pluie de balle en défonçant les vitrine de la chambre  qui éclatait en miette se rejetant dans le vide par dessus le balcon ..Laissant Kate Vandale courir après la chose qui tombait dans le vide le long du château Frontenac avant de s'écraser plus bas dans un choc.. Laissant la chose au os cassé et fracturé ce relevé en boitant et reprenant sa marche au loin disparaissant entre les sirènes et les voitures de polices qui arrivait.
Laissant au sommet du balcon dans le vent la nuit et cette pleine lune la détective Kate Vandale dire.
-Tu peux toujours courir mais tu ne peux pas m'échapper indéfiniment",-0.993,Negative,0.0503767195767196,Netural,-0.32055988907814026,Negative

"I was in grade 5 when this song came out. I had a Halloween school dance. I am a very shy kid and used to just stay in the hallways while in our school gym people would dance, sing and make friends. Me suffering from social anxiety turned to music to help me cope with rough times. I loved this song and knew all of the lyrics. When I was in the hallway I heard this song come on. I walked into the gym with my head high and sung to this song. Even though I didn't sing loudlly and the boys in my grade stared at me, it gave me the confidence I would never have without music. Now, I have been doing online schooling since mid-year grade 6 and I'm now going into highschool(From grade 8 into highschool/grade 9) and this song I will never forget. Thank you Post Malone for bringing back the  memories I though I would forget.♡",0.7553,Positive,0.02388888888888888,Netural,0.6995887160301208,Positive

You are not mine,

Look at the gray-black,

Kajal in the eyes,

"Thanks. Sharing is caring .Dear friend ,ARE YOU SAVED ? IF YOU DIED TONIGHT WILL YOU GO TO HEAVEN OR HELL?
The Bible says: God is holy and heaven is holy which means perfect. God can never let anybody or anything imperfect or sinful enter heaven.
Have you ever lied once? Stolen once? Hated once? The answer is yes .This makes you a liar, a thief and a murderer according to God. So if you were to die this night you will go to hell because you have sinned and the punishment of sin is death.
    The excellent news is that GOD wants you in heaven with Him. But as a just GOD, He has to punish your sins. He has provided a way to save you .There is someone perfect who was willing to take your punishment, mine and the one of the whole world.
 John 3:16 says: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”
So Christ died on the cross for our sins.
         
                        WHAT CAN YOU DO TO BE SAVED?
1- Admit you are a sinner.
                                    2-Be willing to turn from your sins and turn to God (repent).
                                    3-Believe that Jesus died for you, was buried and rose from the dead. Romans 10:9 say: “that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.”
                                    4-Now through prayer, invite Jesus into your life to become your personal savior.
                                     5- Pray this prayer of salvation :( Say it aloud)
Dear God, I come to you in the name of Jesus. I admit I am a sinner. I thank you that you loved me so much to send Your Son to die in my place. I believe in my heart that Jesus Christ died on the cross and shed His blood for my sins, was buried and rose again the third day.
I am willing to turn from my sins .I ask you to forgive me Father.
I now invite you Lord Jesus, to come into my heart and life as my personal Lord and Savior. Amen.
NOW YOU ARE SAVED OR BORN AGAIN WHAT DO YOU DO AFTER?                   
1-Read your Bible everyday to get to know Christ better.
2-Talk to God in prayer everyday.
3-Be baptized, worship, fellowship and serve with other Christians in a good bibelbelieving church.
4-Tell others about Jesus.
  NB: Congratulations .You have just made the most important decision of your life by accepting Jesus.

"John 3:16
[16]For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

Luke 13:3
[3]I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.

John 14:6
[6]Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

Matthew 18:11 
For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.

John 8:12
[12]Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. 

Matthew 4:17
 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

Romans 10:9 
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

Romans 10:13
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. 

Luke 6:27-38
But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, 
6:28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you. 
6:29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also. 
6:30 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again. 
6:31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise. 
6:32 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them. 
6:33 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same. 
6:34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again. 
6:35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil. 
6:36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. 
6:37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: 
6:38 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.


Ephesians 2:8-9
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
Not of works, lest any man should boast.

2 Chronicles 7:14
If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.

Matthew 5:2-12
King James Version
2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,
3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.
10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.

Matthew 24:4-14 
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.
24:5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.
24:6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
24:7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
24:8 All these are the beginning of sorrows.
24:9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
24:10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
24:11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
24:12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.
24:13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.


Exodus 20
King James Version
20 And God spake all these words, saying,

2 I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.

5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;

6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.

7 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:

10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:

11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.

13 Thou shalt not kill.

14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.

15 Thou shalt not steal.

16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (ooh)
Ayy, ayy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Needless to say, I keep her in check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless (yeah)
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (wreck)
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (wreck)

Needless to say, I'm keeping her in check
She was all bad-bad, nevertheless
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck

Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Some things you just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise
And I'm not tryna lose

Then you're left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
You're the sunflower

Every time I'm leavin' on you (ooh)
You don't make it easy, no (no, no)
Wish I could be there for you
Give me a reason to, oh (oh)

Every time I'm walkin' out
I can hear you tellin' me to turn around
Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down
Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh (now)

I know you're scared of the unknown ('known)
You don't wanna be alone (alone)
I know I always come and go (and go)
But it's out of my control

And you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
