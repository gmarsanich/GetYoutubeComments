If ASAP ROCKY and Rihanna have an OPEN RELATIONSHIP, him being with other women is not cheating, because they have an understanding and he's free to do whatever he wants to, as long as he is DISCRETE and RESPECTFUL about it. So, my conclusion is that they have an OPEN RELATIONSHIP...so any woman he has sex with while with Rihanna, based on the rules of their relationship, it's not cheating.",0.9604,Positive,0.1795454545454545,Netural,0.27606216073036194,Netural

Once that money is paid back to the Label, then you start making money off of the music, with the Label getting the bulk of it and you getting very little. Then if your music fails, you are still signed to the Label and can't release any music unless they authorize it...if they don't authorize it, then your career is basically over. INDEPENDENT ARTISTS are smarter than those signed to Labels...at the end of the day, you owe no one anything and if your music fails, you can still make more music and release it whenever you want to.

Body policing is a slippery slope to pushing a r*pe culture narrative that makes it socially acceptable to ignore bodily autonomy of human individuals on the basis of ""real"" vs ""fake"" faces/bodies which then perpetuates pretty privilege. On a side note,  I have all the best wishes for Rihanna and her family but let's not forget that she's not a saint either, and has been caught up in body shaming scandals including body shaming Kendall Jenner when Kendall was still an underage minor and a very adoring fan of Rihanna. I am not saying any of these 3 phenomenally talented, beautiful,  successful women are part of some moral hierarchy.

"Congrats on the new sponsor, Sis. That's dope. I don't see anything wrong w/ what Ariana Grande is doing. The Asian culture (K-Pop) is huge right nah. Why not capitalize off of it? The Asian consumer is typically very loyal. If Ariana can make calculated moves and market herself to that demographic then mo' power to her. Sh¬°t, multiple fan bases translates to multiple streams of income. Music is just too much of a gamble nowadays, especially for black artists. I've gone on record plenty of times stating that artists should leave music alone and branch off into other platforms. I'm in the '90s demographic and history shows that folks my age (36) and older are not interested in supporting new music, especially from '90s artists. Our priorities and tastes have changed over the past 15 - 20 years. Some of us are starting new businesses, purchasing homes, creating families, etcetera. We're not the little girls waiting around for Usher Raymond's newest LP anymore. That time has passed. And guess what? It's not right or wrong. He didn't do anything wrong and we didn't do anything wrong. That's life. The music industry is always looking and booking ahead for fresh, new talent. While Usher Raymond was on top of the world, Christopher Brown was right behind about to do the same thing. That's just how it works. Nobody remains number one forever. Hell, Mr. Michael Jackson was indeed the ""King of Pop"" and we all know what happened to him. Even he couldn't rely on music because by the time he was in the clear, the bubblegum pop invasion had already begun. It's a corporate decision. Anyway, I'm glad artists are thinking ahead and starting new businesses. Do you know that there are still a handful of fans waiting around for Dr. Dre to release another _Chronic_ LP? I'm like, ""If y'all don't go someplace w/ that."" That man ain't thinkin' about no doggon music. Trip though... Would you rather sell $100 headphones (which is a guaranteed sale) or sell $12 music that probably won't get sold, much less heard? 10,000 consumers purchase $100 headphones - you do the math. Most artists make $0.12 per LP sold , after recoupment. If you write then I believe that's $1 to $2 more. 10,000 consumers purchase $12 LPs - you do the math. Nah, no platform is always 100% smooth sailing, but DAMN! Dr. Dre raked in the cash w/ his earphones business. Ms. Rihanna Fenty struck gold w/ her cosmetics line. Mainstream cosmetic lines are indeed a guaranteed sale. Rihanna probably doesn't wanna be boppin' around the stage and promoting music that's gonna be forgotten within a month's span. Darnell Jones and Johnathan Buck released a song back in 2019 entitled, _Understand._ They released that song as a tester to see where the fans' heads were at. And of course they didn't support it. Why bother w/ a full body of work when fans won't even buy a $1.99 single? Eric Ben√©t is doing movies because he knows that the fans don't and won't support his music, independently. Same thing goes for Clifford Smith Jr. (Method Man). Artists would be fools if they waited around for the fans to buy they music. They'd legit end up in the po' house. Anything you give away for free will come back around and fuck you up. A lot of artists see the bigger picture nowadays. Fans of my generation are interested in podcasts and reality tv shows right nah. We're not interested in new music anymore.

I would like to think it's great make up work. It is possible, isn't it?  I mean Oprah's makeup artist is a genius. Chloe is correct about the music industry. It has been going on forever.  It's another American system that needs to be dismantled. I am an advocate for artists receiving mad money for their creations. Artists should all endeavor to be independent recording under the umbrella of a label that is not trying to steal everything they produce. Fans want to see their favorites perform. They shouldn't have to work themselves to death doing it. The one percent are so effing greedy. They structure everything to their benefit. The rest of us just sit around and act as though we are powerless to do something about how the one percent operate. Too many good artists are struggling, and it should not be that way. Your comment about Rihanna choosing better resonates with me. It was the exact sentiment I had the first time I heard she was with ASAP. When she got pregnant, I felt pain. Ugh! It wasn't good news to me. I knew of him prior to Rihanna getting with him. I don't know his upbringing. He impresses me as being thuggish. I get a sense that he is not a decent person. Many of us do like bad boy, edgy types usually to our disappointment. I can't say if he loves her or not. Maybe he loves what she has built. Loyalty doesn't seem to be a character trait he possesses. I'm just really sorry to see her life playing out like this. Sometimes we want more for people than they want for themselves.

 1st of all, miss Ariana Grande people need to just get over it because she is about change and evolution that's what keeps her fresh and it Is what keeps them tuned in period
 2nd, she has a right to go after the money because it's there and she's a business woman point blank. She enjoys entertaining but she also is securing her financial future and that of her offsprings so tell them to get over that as well it's about the business. The kardashians didn't get rich by sitting up just taking pictures they started businesses.
 3rd, I don't wanna sound like I'm not compassionate but if Rihanna knew ASAP the way that they claim to be best friends, then she knew all of this was coming, she just did not know when!!! are you ever really prepared for it even though you know it's coming?

This is like life for us that we know one day we're gonna die we just don't know how, or when, or where, and in this case, that was inevitable because hes a celebrity that has a lot of money and this is a litigious state, so what now?  He not only will serve prison time but the guy will have means to Sue and silver court and now they're Rihanna's attached to him his problems become her problems her problems money can be an option because you can never have too much of it.

Lastly,The rumors of ASAP cheating prior to getting with her the way they are now, he admitted that he has multiple women at even one time and all of that is gonna change because hes in love? Oh! Come on...
 like I said if she really knew him then those cheating things should not be a surprise because that is who he is. he's loved other women before and look at how many relationships he has gone through ? I'm sure he told some of those women he loved them too but yet he was seeing other people keep it real.... he went thru the Kardashians alleged??? Soooo...
 You know who you're getting with when you get with them, you just choose what parts of that you're going to deal with...

As for Ariana, she been changing faces and races for years and I would never buy any makeup from someone who can't stay in their original skin and whose face has changed constantly over the years. She is no different from the Kardashians-Jenners, Miley Cyrus, etc, they all appropriate at some point, but never would I ever purchase their products. Smart for her to go into makeup, but there are already alot of makeup brands and I only purchase products from POC(black owned makeup brands) not brands that are doing nothing different from the already established brands out there. Also Ariana has been accused blackfish/cultural appropriation far too many times and called out by black women too many times to like anything outside of her music.

As for Chloe, we already know how the music industry is. She still signed the contract. If my memory is correct, they signed a 1 million dollar 6 album contract as minors, which means their parents signed them off to Beyonce in a horrible basically 360 deal, but we have been heard this.

"People REALLY need to understand that just because Chloe (or anyone) PROFESSES to know God with their SPEECH, that doesn't mean that they are TRULY LIVING for Him with their ACTIONS and LIFESTYLE. Far too often in our culture, if a famous person just happens to mention ""God"" then it seems like everyone wants to label them as a ""Christian"" instead of really examining the person's CHARACTER and FRUIT....and that can be dangerous on so many different levels.

Chloe has DEFINITELY compromised her christian convictions (doing raunchy videos, using profanity, etc.), and has decided to make her CAREER the true lord of her life instead of Jesus and His ways. I hope she realizes that the Lord is worth more than anything that she can gain in Hollywood....and even though she has compromised and turned away from the ways of God, she can still repent, give her life to Jesus, and start taking a stand for His RIGHTEOUS ways. Jesus said, ""What does it profit a person if they gain the WHOLE WORLD but lose their OWN SOUL?""

""For the lips of an immoral woman are as sweet as honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil. But in the end she is as bitter as poison, as dangerous as a double-edged sword. Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave. For she cares nothing about the path to life. She staggers down a crooked trail and doesn‚Äôt realize it. So now, my sons, listen to me. Never stray from what I am about to say: Stay away from her! Don‚Äôt go near the door of her house! If you do, you will lose your honor and will lose to merciless people all you have achieved. Strangers will consume your wealth, and someone else will enjoy the fruit of your labor. In the end you will groan in anguish when disease consumes your body."" (Proverbs 5:3-11)",-0.8422,Negative,0.057192460317460295,Netural,-0.2605481445789337,Negative
