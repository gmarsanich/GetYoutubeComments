He is questioning himself at times and I love that!

Also, really love taht this chaos doesn't even get graced with an intro of any sort. It's just starting right in. It also doesn't get a real outtro, just Mark affirming that he doesn't plan to explain anything. Probably for the best. 

'would this make me a furry if I smash this?'

"By trimming the seemingly useless fat of an introduction section, Marcus reminds us of its importance. He flings us into an ocean of passes, and despite us being aware of this ocean and its functions- it still baffels us. We have been suckling of the teat of internet content for years and have grown accustomed to its internal rules and regulations. Marcus violently rips us from these expectations and cuts directly to the bone of entertainment. It takes minutes for him to say a word other than those displayed in the title yet we see emotions burst in all directions, a grandiose finale of fireworks that the entire experience of pokemon, Markaplier, and the “smash or pass” trend has seemingly lead up to.
