It genuinely feels like I\u2019m watching an actual Covert Ops mission!", "Flannel dude gives me Ghost Recon Breakpoint vibes.", "\"So which MTF unit should we deploy for this mission?\"\n\n\" *YES* \"", "Okay overall this was an amazing movie great job on it but some all the tactics were a little strange, for one thing when they're walking through that open field I was thinking all they're going to get ambushed. But overall great job!", "The face he made after the figure moved at 19:17 was that of a professional actor.

The door was checked and opened instead of attempting to kick it down/shoot it down; everyone was communicating; I saw a few pats  on the shoulder to indicate to the man in front that there\u2019s somebody behind; everybody checked their corners and knew where to look at the end of a hall and into a room. Very good, I like this.", "Yeah good job on this , it was very real because in real life there are many unanswered questions. And here being up against something you don't understand and just dropped into the hot zone not knowing what to expect.  This was a great film and alot can be done with this story. It's unsettling because you're waiting for something to happen and it's not what you would expect.", "Awesome", "Dream job, damn this was fucking sick I can't stop watching!!!", "I had a police helicopter flying around overhead barking something i r l all it did was add to the weirdness. This was absolutely fantastic!", "New fan, nice quality work", "Re-watching for the 5th time, it's still gold.

Wow..... lol.  ANOMOLOUS, BOI", "The MTF doesn't come off military enough, more civilian :(   Make these mofos hardened and serious, it would make a more serious impact", "Oh we\u2019re special agents that wear flannel", "I\u2019d load a full fucking mag into that thing", "The one gripe I have about these short films is that the MTFs would be allowed to have shitposts/stickers on their gear. I think it takes the seriousness out a bit when one of the operators have a TMNT sticker on his chest. In SCP: Dollhouse one of the MTF operators there had an anime one. Is it just me that feels this way? Everything else is golden.", "Wow! Finally SCP foundation movie! I made a comment on another video about the SCP, that it should be made into a movie or series the saga has so much potential due to the vast amount of different kind of anomalies and stories.

Fantastic work!", "Theres a small detail for mtf is that they wear black glass", "What does SCP stands for?", "I like that, since they said Epsilon-6 (a rural/suburban MTF unit) would be the primary entry force and that they\u2019d be backed mainly by Nu-7 (a heavy duty militaristic task force), you can see that when they arrive at the house, the MTF units in the very front,most likely Epsilon-6, are dressed in more casual clothing in comparison to the more militarist Nu-7 units behind them.", "An explanation of the MTFs featured and/or mentioned in this short film (as provided by the SCP-wiki):\n\n*Epsilon-6 (The Village Idiots):* Specializes in the investigation, containment, and subsequent cleanup of anomalies in rural and suburban environments.\n\n*Nu-7 (Hammer Down):* Armed Mobile Task Force Nu-7 is a battalion-strength force consisting of three company-sized elements of special operations infantry forces, a light armored vehicle company, tank platoon, helicopter squadron, chemical-biological-radiological-nuclear (CBRN) platoon, combat engineer platoon, nuclear weapon specialist (NWS) squad, plus additional combat specialist and support personnel. AMTF Nu-7 is based primarily out of Armed Bio-Containment Area-14 and is tasked with responding to incidents involving loss of communication with major Foundation facilities under circumstances wherein a site-wide breach, enemy compromise, or other similarly catastrophic event is suspected.\n\n*Zeta-9 (Mole Rats):* Mobile Task Force Zeta-9 specializes in the investigation, exploration, and containment of underground or enclosed areas exhibiting anomalous phenomena, particularly those with inconsistent topography or unstable spacetime.\n\n*Mu-13 (Ghostbusters):* Mobile Task Force Mu-13 specializes in the tracking, analysis, and containment of incorporeal or intangible manifestations and entities, particularly those believed to be sentient, sapient, or otherwise intelligent and adaptive.\n\n*Beta-7 (Maz Hatters):* Mobile Task Force Beta-7 specializes in the acquisition and containment of anomalies exhibiting extreme biological, chemical, or radiological hazards as well as the rapid containment and cleanup of areas affected by such anomalies. This includes the planning and deployment of contingencies for wide-area or pandemic spread of anomalous disease agents or other contagious phenomena.\n\n*Lambda-5 (White Rabbits):* Mobile Task Force Lambda-5 specializes in traversing unstable, surreal, and controlled reality, and containing potentially dangerous persons and artifacts capable of manipulating space and time.\n\n*Gamma-5 (Red Herrings):* Mobile Task Force Gamma-5 specializes in preventing the dissemination of knowledge of anomalous events or phenomena in cases where initial suppression efforts have proven ineffective or insufficient, or in cases where such knowledge has already reached critical levels of public exposure.
