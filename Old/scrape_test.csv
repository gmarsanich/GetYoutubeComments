5,"For the lack of firepits issue, maybe one thing you can do is buy sleeping bags and set them up across key locations in the map? You would have good reason to showcase crafting up the tent to set a sleeping spot in the open.
Also, there's a loot item called firestarter set. I'm not sure if it spawns a firepit. I've never used it B4 but it's just my guess.",1,2 weeks ago,/channel/UCK5ruvqgbWDxuBZOW-x84jQ,Daryl Meng

7,"Hey there. Your vids are nice, I might binge em later on. But I have a question. I've seen another youtuber play anomaly on Call of Pripyat, and now you on Shadow of Chernobyl. I'm wondering, which one is better? I don't know which one to buy. I have no idea what makes them different. I'm completely new to the stalker series",1,3 weeks ago,/channel/UC-tgAzB8SHYvzSynDQQD_7w,Dakota Mason
8,"I wouldnt say its impossible to do the challenge as Monolith, but it would be more complicated, they usually ask for random artifacts, 20~30 faction patches and high tier mutant parts (sometimes around 10 flesh or dog meat) or some kinda of meds, the easiest tasks would probably be to kill loners in the outskirts and find documents in the red forest, very rarely I've got someone to kill in Jupiter/retrieve docs there, so if you throw all your gear away the only way would be to find 2 companions and rely on them while being a vulture for loot, personally not the way I like to play, but would defenetely be interesting to watch.Also, instead of cats you get Chimeras running at your yard, I had 2 of them literally bust into the base right after I woke up in the basement coach e-e",1,3 weeks ago,/channel/UC8lnHwvSqdg39cdJ0eyukIg,Serj Rocks

10,"Wishful thinking 4Weapons over 98% have clean scopes.
Tipp: ""Your reputaion has worsened."" indicates not a decrease of your rank, but an increase in fear among stalkers (presumably because of stealth kills)Tough I don't know if it actually makes factions hate/like you more.",1,10 days ago,/channel/UCijdapYsibdQnwWYMfDu6Kg,Philonius II.
