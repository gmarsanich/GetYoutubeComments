Cometi erros, mas me esforçava para que tudo fosse o que imaginei que o amor seria. E foi! Houveram belos dias, em que a satisfação e pertencimento ao momento geraram sensações inenarráveis. Era tomado por uma felicidade tão grande e constante que, por vezes, causava dependência. E no momento mais bonito, tudo acabou. Não por culpa de um ou d'outro, mas por circunstâncias maiores que amor. O destino, enquanto brinca ao ensinar, nos faz provar o mais doce e também experimentar o mais amargo. Me apeguei a essa música, dolorosamente. Passaram-se dias, semanas, meses e completaram-se anos. E tudo o que eu pensava era: será que um dia, ouvirei sem sentir dor? Nunca houve absoluta certeza, pois o simples acaso de me deparar com a melodia, gerava um sentimento superior a maturidade ou controle emocional. E por vezes e vezes eu chorei, com essa mesma versão. O tempo não ajudou, muito embora sempre me questionasse sobre \"quando\"? Até que um dia, o amor me curou. E esse sentimento foi advento de algo que, embora transcendesse meu ser, se conflitava com uma barreira de proteção. Não por medo, tampouco falta de esperança, mas voltado única e exclusivamente a minha pessoa. O amor, de fato, é a cura. E o amor próprio foi a resposta. Sim, foi tão possível me sentir machucado quanto curado por esse sentimento. Quando ama-se a si, o amor pode curar. É capaz de reparar todos os danos e dar tanto aos dias, músicas e sentimento a capacidade de ressignificação. O amor permanece por aí, e está aqui. E será sempre surpreendentemente belo, apesar de quando e como o encontramos ou desencontramos. E também viverá no que permanece. Portanto, sempre será uma honra viver para amar.", "In the beginning I didn’t know who do kid was then I noticed it was ur childhood", "Bu şarkıya bayılıyorum bana kedimi cesurumu hatırlatıyor. bu şarkıyı çok severdi çok dinleyemedi ama en sevdiği şarkıydı, o yüzden bu şarkıyı ne zaman duysam aklıma o geliyor hanı içimizde mutlulu olur ama bi yandanda onu özlersiniz ya ağlamak istersiniz hatta ağlarsınız ama yinede mutlusunuzdur. her gece onu dusunuyorum.
