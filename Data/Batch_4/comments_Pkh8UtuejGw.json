IF YOU DIED TONIGHT WILL YOU GO TO HEAVEN OR HELL?\nThe Bible says: God is holy and heaven is holy which means perfect. God can never let anybody or anything imperfect or sinful enter heaven.\nHave you ever lied once? Stolen once? Hated once? The answer is yes .This makes you a liar, a thief and a murderer according to God. So if you were to die this night you will go to hell because you have sinned and the punishment of sin is death.\n    The excellent news is that GOD wants you in heaven with Him. But as a just GOD, He has to punish your sins. He has provided a way to save you .There is someone perfect who was willing to take your punishment, mine and the one of the whole world.\n John 3:16 says: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”\nSo Christ died on the cross for our sins.\n         \n                        WHAT CAN YOU DO TO BE SAVED?\n1- Admit you are a sinner.\n                                    2-Be willing to turn from your sins and turn to God (repent).\n                                    3-Believe that Jesus died for you, was buried and rose from the dead. Romans 10:9 say: “that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.”\n                                    4-Now through prayer, invite Jesus into your life to become your personal savior.\n                                     5- Pray this prayer of salvation :( Say it aloud)\nDear God, I come to you in the name of Jesus. I admit I am a sinner. I thank you that you loved me so much to send Your Son to die in my place. I believe in my heart that Jesus Christ died on the cross and shed His blood for my sins, was buried and rose again the third day.\nI am willing to turn from my sins .I ask you to forgive me Father.\nI now invite you Lord Jesus, to come into my heart and life as my personal Lord and Savior. Amen.\nNOW YOU ARE SAVED OR BORN AGAIN WHAT DO YOU DO AFTER?                   \n1-Read your Bible everyday to get to know Christ better.\n2-Talk to God in prayer everyday.\n3-Be baptized, worship, fellowship and serve with other Christians in a good bibelbelieving church.\n4-Tell others about Jesus.\n  NB: Congratulations .You have just made the most important decision of your life by accepting Jesus.\n\n TO START TO LEARN ABOUT GOD :www.EnseigneMoi.com\n-www.cfaith  .com                    \n                                                                      -Watch Ron Wyatt Amazing Discoveries Full on youtube.", "English: Shakira is back!!!

It will reshape the world, as it is likely that other latent frictions between countries and territories will be activated as a consequence of the Russia-Ukraine situation. This war just opened an era of wars, small and large, between different peoples.\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently said that this war could easily become \"the biggest war in Europe since 1945\", and I agree. If countries with similar backgrounds cannot reach agreement between them, then how much more likely it is that several countries that have big differences and ancient conflicts may easily slip into war for no apparent justifiable reason.\nOn a personal level, it saddens me to see how fate turns around and once again we find ourselves at war. I am sorry and restless since I have many students in Russia and Ukraine who are under threat and feel how the deteriorating situation is affecting them and the whole world. In Israel, too, I have many students who follow with concern what is happening in Eastern Europe, anxious about the fate of their family members and friends.\nMy hope is that the manifestations of hatred between the Russians and the Ukrainians will stop soon, two peoples who have lived side by side throughout history. If it were still possible, I would give everything I could to silence, calm down, avoid the escalation, but this is impossible for now. \nThere is not much that we can do at this stage. We can only long for peace and a ceasefire, talk about all parties showing restraint. The parties in conflict could follow the example of the Native American tribes who buried their hostility in a ceremony during which previously warring tribes agreed to settle their differences and live in harmony, and sealed their agreement by the chief of each tribe burying a war hatchet in the ground. \nSuch a scenario does not look realistic under the current circumstances. Thus, above the forces of hostility, above the egoism and control as the driving forces of all the conflicts in the world, we can only raise a global prayer for peace, asking that we all get along with everyone. Because only in the power of connection and in the connection between our hearts, can a great positive force arise, a force that is able to unite all parties, to reconcile the haters, to awaken the truth in us all that we all belong to one soul.
