This is number 5 MUSICALLY That beat is quite driving and the vocals work well. He sings this well. Not too crowded. I love the spaces in this. LYRICALLY The song sounds like it has been constructed a lot better than the previous song Shivers. You can tell that the lyrics fit the song rather than trying to fit some random lyrics into it. It sticks with a theme and doesn't wander off in strange directions. VIDEO Cleverly constructed and makes it memorable. Ed Sheeran's character is well constructed.
