He loves you immensely, open up Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John in your Bible and read about Him. Get to know who He is :). John 14:6- Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\"✝️❤ Being a Christian will not always be easy, and does not mean that you won't experience temptation and sin; we are humans after all. Furthermore, we must ask for forgiveness for all of our sins. You may lay your burdens at His feet. Forgiving others for their sins is also very important. \n\nJesus said- \"14For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 15But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.\" (Matthew 6:14-15) \n\n\"8If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. 9If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. 10If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us.\" (1 John 1:8-10) \n\n“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.\" (Matthew 11:28).\nWe are cleansed by the blood of Jesus because of His great sacrifice on the cross. \n\n\" 16For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.\" (John 3:16-18) \n\n\"6If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth. 7But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin.\" (1 John 1:6-7) \n\nIf you seek God, you are seeking eternity with Him!\nGod bless you all, seek Him and you WILL find Him🙏🏾❤", "2022 anyone??", "Anyone watch  this masterpiece in 2022 ..😀", "This song never gets old.

Most people do. However, most of us differ as to the definition of \"good.\" The Bible says that God is good, and the Ten Commandments are His standard of goodness. So, we will look at God's Law . . . With a tender conscience, ask yourself if you have obeyed the following: \n\n1. You shall have no other gods before Me. (Have you always loved God above all else?)\n2. You shall not make yourself an idol. (Have you made a god in your mind that you're more comfortable with, a god to suit yourself?)\n3. You shall not take God's name in vain. (Have you ever used God's holy Name as a cuss word?)\n4. Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy.\n5. Honor your father and mother.\n6. You shall not murder. (God considers hatred to be as murder).\n7. You shall not commit adultery. (\"Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart\" Matthew 5:27-28; this also includes sex before marriage).\n8. You shall not steal. (Have you ever stolen anything? the value of the item is irrelevant).\n9. You shall not lie. (Have you lied even once? Including answering these questions).\n10. You shall not covet. (Have you ever jealously desired what belongs to others?)\nThe Bible says that God will punish all murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, adulterers, etc. He will even judge our words and thoughts. On Judgment Day, will you be found to be guilty or innocent of breaking His commandments? \n\nPerhaps you think that God is good, and will therefore overlook your sins. But it is His goodness that will make sure that murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, etc. receive justice. He would be a corrupt Judge if He turned a blind eye to injustice. Have you kept the Commandments? \n\nThe Bible says that the Law is perfect. It commands you to be perfect (Matthew 5:48). Are you perfect (in thought, word, and deed)? Will you make it to Heaven? You may say that you are still good, but God says you're not (see Psalm 14:2-3). So one of you is lying, and the Scriptures tell us that it is impossible for God to lie. Remember that all liars will be cast into the Lake of Fire (Revelation 21:8). God's Law demands justice, and the penalty for sinning against Him is death and Hell. Listen carefully if you want to live. \n\nGod Himself made a way where His justice and His goodness could meet. We broke the Law, but He became a man to pay the fine. Jesus suffered and died on the cross to satisfy the Law. God can forgive us and grant us the gift of everlasting life! But you may still think that you can (from now on) keep the Ten Commandments. But isn't it true that the best of us have lied, stolen, lusted, hated, failed to love God above all else, and failed to love our neighbor as ourselves? \n\nHow can we then, live a \"good\" life if we have already sinned against God? At best we are reformed liars and thieves . . . but still Lawbreakers. Think of it this way - would you sell one of your eyes for a million dollars? Would you sell both for $50 million? I'm sure you wouldn't. Your eyes are priceless, yet they are merely the windows of your soul. What then must your life (soul) be worth? With these thoughts in mind, what would be a fair price to pay for everlasting life? It is utterly without price. Yet, if we trust in our own goodness to enter Heaven, we are saying to God, \"I should enter Heaven because I have done good - I have earned my way in.\" \n\nImagine if you wanted to give me a brand new (very expensive) car, but I said, \"I can't take it! I feel embarrassed receiving such a gift . . . here's 10 cents for it.\" I'm sure you would be very insulted by such a pathetic offer of payment. Besides, if I pay for it, it is no longer a gift, it's a purchase . . . it's mine by right. \n\nWhen we talk of entering Heaven by being good, by trying to keep the Ten Commandments etc., we are tossing God 10 cents of \"self-righteousness,\" which is a terrible insult to Him, in the light of His sacrifice. The only thing we can do is humble ourselves, repent of our sins, and receive the gift by trusting Jesus Christ alone. Almighty God demonstrated how much He loves you when Jesus suffered for you on the cross. If you want to trust in your own goodness, then you are saying His agonizing death on the cross was in vain. The Bible says, \"For by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.\" You cannot earn a gift. \n\nWhen Jesus said to \"believe\" on Him, He was saying we should have faith in Him, in the same way you would trust a parachute to save you when you jump from a plane. You don't merely believe in the parachute - you put it on. Please don't \"jump\" without Jesus. If you die in your sins there is no second chance. God will give you justice, and you will end up in Hell forever. Any troubles you have at present are dwarfed by the trouble you are in with your Creator. His wrath abides upon you (John 3:36). God doesn't want you to go to Hell. Neither do you want to go there, so confess your sins to God right now, put your trust in Jesus to save you, and you will pass from death to life. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. (See John 14:21). Your obedience to God is the proof of your love. Have faith in God, He will never fail you. \n\nPray something like this: \n\n\"Dear God, today I turn away from all of my sins (name them). This day I put my trust in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. He is the only way for me to be saved. He is 'The way, the truth, and the life.'\" Please forgive me, change my heart, and grant me Your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.\"", "ROCK IN RIO 22?
