It's my pleasure to introduce to you

All the way from Memphis, Tennessee
And he's got something special for y'all tonight
He's gonna sing a song for y'all about this girl

Yeah, come on
On that sunny day
Didn't know I'd meet
Such a beautiful girl
Walking down the street
Seen those bright brown eyes
With tears coming down
She deserves a crown
But where is it now? Mama, listen
Se√±orita, I feel for you
You deal with things that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love
If you just lay in my
Running fast in my mind
Girl, won't you slow it down?
If we carry on this way
This thing might leave the ground
How would you like to fly?
That's how my queen should ride
But you still deserve the crown
Well, hasn't it been found?

"Jesus Christ Saves

Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.

Jesus Christ died on the cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later to pay for the sins of mankind to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.

EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:

1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.
2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.

Some success and some failure, but the point is that there is a senorita out there for everyone. In a spiritual sense the higher power is a senorita with an attitude. Girls naturally show more attitude to their boyfriends and husbands when they care more about them. God loves all and believes in everyone and their potential and so does the evil and negative forces in this world.",0.2382,Positive,0.05757575757575755,Netural,0.7075125575065613,Positive

"""Senorita""

[Pharrell:]
Ladies and gentlemen
It's my pleasure to introduce to you
He's a friend of mine

[Justin:]
Yes, yes I am

[Pharrell:]
And he goes by the name...
Justin
Wowoowoooo

All the way
from Memphis, Tennessee
And he's got somethin' special for y'all tonight
He's gonna sing a song for y'all
About this girl

[Justin:]
Come in right here?

[Pharrell:]
Yea, come on

On that sunny day
Didn't know I'd meet
Such a beautiful girl
Walking down the street
Seen those bright brown eyes
With tears coming down
She deserves a crown
But where is it now
Mamma listen

Senorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love
If you just lay in my...

Running fast in my mind
Girl don't you slow it down
If we carry on this way
This thing might leave the ground
How would you like to fly?
That's how my queen should ride
But you still deserve the crown
or hasn't it been found?
Mamma listen

Senorita, I feel for you
(Feel for you)
You deal with things, that you don't have to
(No, no)
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
(He don't love ya baby)
But you could feel this real love
(Feel it)
If you just lay in my...

Ah, ah, arms...
(Won't you lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms...
(Mama lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms...
(Baby won't you lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms...

When I look into your eyes
I see something that money can't buy
And I know if you give us a try
I'll work hard for you girl
And no longer will you ever have to cry

Senorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
(Deal with things you don't have to)
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
(No, no)
But you could feel this real love
(Feel it)
If you just lay in my...

Ah, ah, arms...
(Whoa)
Ah, ah, arms...
(My baby)
Ah, ah, arms...
(Oooh, yea)
Ah, ah, arms...

When I look into your eyes
I see something that money can't buy
And I know if you give us a try
I'll work hard for you girl
You won't ever cry

Now listen
I wanna try somethin' right now
See they don't do this anymore
I'ma sing something
And I want the guys to sing wit' me
They go
""It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?""
And then the ladies go
""I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you""

Guys sing
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
And ladies
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you
Feels good don't it, come on
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
Yea, ladies
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you
Show the good to me

Sing it one more time
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
Ladies
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you
Yea, yea..
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
Ladies
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you

Didn't know I'd meet
Such a beautiful girl
Walking down the street
Seen those bright brown eyes
With tears coming down
She deserves a crown
But where is it now
Mamma listen

Senorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love
If you just lay in my...

Running fast in my mind
Girl don't you slow it down
If we carry on this way
This thing might leave the ground
How would you like to fly?
That's how my queen should ride
But you still deserve the crown
or hasn't it been found?
Mamma listen

Senorita, I feel for you
(Feel for you)
You deal with things, that you don't have to
(No, no)
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
(He don't love ya baby)
But you could feel this real love
(Feel it)
If you just lay in my...

Ah, ah, arms...
(Won't you lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms...
(Mama lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms...
(Baby won't you lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms...

When I look into your eyes
I see something that money can't buy
And I know if you give us a try
I'll work hard for you girl
And no longer will you ever have to cry

Senorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
(Deal with things you don't have to)
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
(No, no)
But you could feel this real love
(Feel it)
If you just lay in my...

Ah, ah, arms...
(Whoa)
Ah, ah, arms...
(My baby)
Ah, ah, arms...
(Oooh, yea)
Ah, ah, arms...

When I look into your eyes
I see something that money can't buy
And I know if you give us a try
I'll work hard for you girl
You won't ever cry

Now listen
I wanna try somethin' right now
See they don't do this anymore
I'ma sing something
And I want the guys to sing wit' me
They go
""It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?""
And then the ladies go
""I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you""

Guys sing
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
And ladies
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you
Feels good don't it, come on
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
Yea, ladies
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you
Show the good to me

Sing it one more time
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
Ladies
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you
Yea, yea..
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
Ladies
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you

Gentlemen, good night
Ladies, good morning
