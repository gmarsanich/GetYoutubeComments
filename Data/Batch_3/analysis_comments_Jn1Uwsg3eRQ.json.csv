This song has a special place in my heart. I was born and brought up in a Catholic family in Texas and my boyfriend was born and brought up in a strict Hindu family back in India. He moved to the states for college. We met in class and instantly fell for each other. The difference in our races created many obstacles for us. Even our parents stood between us because of the religious differences. But we stuck to it and fought all those battles together and today we are the happiest of couples.I hope we get to live with each other forever. ❤️🇺🇸🇮🇳❤️❤️❤️ ❤️❤️❤️,0.714,Positive,0.06935064935064936,Netural,0.6768361330032349,Positive

"There’s only a handful of artists I really like of the last 25-30 years.   Lady Gaga, Adele, Alicia Keys, Pink...

But, Billie has really moved into that small pack of music artists I’ve come to like.  And, it all started when she just so happen to be the music guest One night when I watched this SNL episode. 

That last minute I’ve rewound an embarrassing amount of times. One of the coolest guest performer’s ever imho. 

When she did that vicious knee up (with walking boot to... well, boot😊), it was the start of 1,000 replays of that clip. And, looked up more of her other stuff and really started to like her and found out what the whole excitement about her really was. 

Amazing talent. And still young enough to possibly record even more cool tunes before pursuing something else.",0.9851,Positive,0.08289473684210527,Netural,0.4244694113731384,Positive

Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows

Bruises on both my knees for you

My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at being bad, bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?

Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul so cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
