"PewDie, you're probably not gonna see this message but assuming you do...try getting your hands on (1) discontinued ""Paradigm 12"" amplified subwoofer matched with (2) ""Monoprice Monolith-M212's"", (2) Monoprice Monolith mm-r5's and (1) Polk s35 Sign.Ser. center speaker. If it feels like there isn't enough Mids, add two additional monitor speakers in opposition to the first two making it. 7.1 as oppose to 5.1, just stick with Monolith monitors if you can and I can't imagine a more premium setup...that's of course your mainline amplifier/PA could provide the monitors/sub-stacks/center/etc the necessary wattage! Hope this helps you create you/anyone an awesome system.
