You can compliment the talents of blackpink without dragging down another group. Yes, Blackpink is talented even when they debuted. Their Coachella performance was amazing. That's great! Just say that. You don't need to compare them with another group to prove that point. Even if aespa was sold as the ""second blackpink"" by gossip media, it doesn't mean you have to play into their rules and start comparing them constantly while bashing a group of girls who are also just trying their best (not to mention they probably never referred themselves as such a title). No one is going to take down blackpink. They don't need you to ""protect"" them by being sassy towards aespa. 

I am completely neutral between both groups, and I understand the talents of both.

Entah deh gak stabil mereka karena fokus ngedance/dance hard dan lagunya berat buat dibawa live, kasihan juga idolanya bawa lagu yg sulit dg highnote dan dance begini. Kalo masalah crack gak masalah, toh crack sekali pas highnote itu. Lain kali agensinya kalo ngasih lagu buat aespa gak perlu terlalu unjuk highnote, highnotnya juga kyk saling unggul-unggulan gitu  terus sambil ngedance sambil ngedance dan dancenya gk perlunya yg banyak nguras stamina. Apalagi kayaknya agensi aespa punya rencana promosi diluar. Perform diluar kyk amerika itu harus live, kalo gak live bakal dipertanyakan. Kalo agensi aespa pingin lipsing mending promosi di korea sm asia aja deh. Di korea punya seribu cara agar idolanya kelihatan nyanyi live tapi lipsing. Entah tradisi/ciri khas dari agensi aespa lagu grup2nya mesti pakai highnote. Padahal mah kalo gaet org awam/publik yg penting lagunya bagus dan publik gak bakal peduli soal highnote gituan. Btw giselle banyak kemajuan. Ningning dan giselle sdh berusaha ngehype penonton dan have fun di panggung. Winter mirip dg aslinya dan paling stabil.
Satu lagi agensi aespa ini dikenal dg agensi yg punya vokal2 terbaik tapi makin ke sini agensinya malah banyak nyuruh idolnya lipsing. Sementang punya tittle itu jangan disalahgunakan dong. Jangankan live perform festival, nyanyi live di radio buat promosi lagu aja gak pernah lagi, mana tuh pernah aespa dan nct dream nyanyi live di radio, nyanyi lagu mereka sendiri. Nct dream nyanyi live radio di kandang sendiri yang mana juga gak pure live, karena bisa diproses editing. Aneh banget makin lama agensinya.

this is probably blackpink thingy simply the 'yg thingi' and i also think it's all about experience. Blackpink got to perform at Coachella after 3 years of debuting and 6 years of training so they simply slay there but sm made aespa perform there with their short experience and  also made them lip sync which eventually became a disadvantage but their live vocals and voice dosen't sound bad either.

"Think of it this way. Both groups have 2-3 years experience before Coachella experience. But the clear situation here is actually the difference in the way their agency trains them.

"Aespa is incredibly talented, and I'm sure they learned so much from this experience, which I'm sure is what SM was hoping for. An area that they can work on is being more comfortable on the stage enough to be able to veer from choreography when they're trying to interact with the crowd. It felt very...staged, like they were so tied to the choreo that it limited them. Blackpink and 2ne1 just have way more experience doing that. They're used to concerts; Aespa is more used to performances. They'll get there. Aespa is too talented not to.",0.9551,Positive,0.41071428571428564,Positive,-0.4464874863624573,Negative

"This is Aespa's first performance in front of big crowd because they debuted in the middle of covid-19 and it's in a foreign country and not even their concert they're performing not just in front of their fans 
But they did great ... I would be so happy watching a performance like this ... their live vocals are insane",0.932,Positive,0.10767045454545454,Netural,-0.3084176182746887,Negative
Aespa will forever be known as Copycats /Blackpink  dupes after this. Their vocals which is their strongest point doesnt even exceed blackpinks  1 hour live vocals. They literally made Blackpink undefeated by copying everything they do.  SM shouldnt have bought tickets.. He shouldve waited  for Coachella to invite aespa like Blackpink was invited authentically. Embarassing and cheap move.,0.7184,Positive,0.2681818181818182,Netural,-0.7457409501075745,Negative
