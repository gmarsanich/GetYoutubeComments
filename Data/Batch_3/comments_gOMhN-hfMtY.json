My German is bad, my English is much worse. my hands are ugly because i can write many things make many claims because the omnipotence of my god is limitless and immeasurable. it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich and powerful man to reach heaven these words are true and true those who are given power are all the more required to give everything for the benefit of the future of the people who come after us, we are even just a guest on this planet, we are small souls, but if you turn your back on the commandments then you distance yourself from God. could write a lot of what i have seen . that I found people's plans on the internet on November 9th, 2015, terror attack plans like Paris November 13th, 2015, Brussels 2016, various other events that I flew over, Corona to wipe out the small businesses and weaken people even to kill them. destruction of berlin and moscow 2026, a world war with a religious cloak to put the anti christ at the top of the world government. people are taught wrongly by the media and pushed into the abyss without the core of the heart starting to grow it does not grow with self-love because who loves himself is removed from the love for our almighty eternal holy creator. Whoever loves God wants to keep his commandments out of love, one tries harder and opposes this world. the sabbath day should be kept holy the holy commandments should be kept out of love . one picks the best example of all and that is Yeshua . God showed me his strong arm when he saved me from the guardians of human law because my actions also angered him, I attacked the church thinking about the attack in Paris on November 13th, 2015. i love the earth and yet i hate it. far away is she from the kingdom of heaven . Far away are people to the point where Yeshua led me before the thron of God. behind the door is bright white light a sinner trembles at the thought of being a sinner and coming before god. Yeshua is the way, truth and life. no one comes to the Father but only through him. I can't save anyone, but I don't have to either, actually, I couldn't care less about people, but they aren't, they are little souls who are taught wrong and are used like a handkerchief by the shameful doings of the house of discord and then thrown away. how dare you undo the toil and work of parents educators nannies? how dare you iluminati jesuit masons even in school teach people wrong in religion class and ignore amazing facts? How should I pitiful wretch that crawls like a tortoise in its shell ever find the right words the closer you get to god the more lost you feel and yet you feel and notice that he is omnipresent. actually i wouldn't be here people teach me hard and in people's fantasies you can find pandorya's box. people have sick fantasies that are encouraged by this sick world. and yet I found my future hidden in a few human fantasies, but it was only years later that I noticed that God loved me. . keep the commandments of God out of love and take Yeshua as an example then you will also recognize how sick and far away people are. sorry i'm just a coward who can't open his mouth outside. so i use the internet to write how i think how i feel. one day Yeshua will come with his almighty eternal holy Creator with the angels with them the golden city and the vast new world where people live in peace love harmony. offered myself as a sacrifice many years ago , i got no answer i threw my hate on god and myself for many years i blamed him for the suffering misery wars hunger in the world. I was punished hard and justly and was also strict with myself because I tried to do the right thing even without God. I didn't want to hate people. the meaning of life is not to have fun it is to strive to grow in the right direction. instead of the love for our creator growing in their hearts, in the core of their hearts, people prefer to anger the lamb should i stop him? no, because the deeds of Rothschild rockefeller and co. also anger me . they call themselves jews and yet like the pharisah they are far away their wisdom became a noose around their necks . they follow the warnings of the prophets who were there to lead people back to the right path. People are starving and yet they strive to take the world hostage so they want to destroy the earth beforehand and live in bunkers and laugh about it if you want it then do this live forever in the bunker until the sun swallows the earth. you want to breed people in vessels and enjoy yourselves now nice devilish plan, many thoughts are disgusting and contemptuous in people. you want to create an AI how should an AI feel how should an AI understand love when it lacks the divine spark in the core of the heart. you want to intervene in the DNA of God's masterpiece and make people your slaves how ill your perversions get the house of god fucks children don't you know that you cost yourself eternal life by doing so. turn back, otherwise the king of babylon will get you and he will do with you what he wants. he recognized the greatness of the almighty, eternal creator from whom nothing remains hidden. he knows people better than they know themselves someone who withdrew from people and fled into people's fantasies he knew before it was he left excerpts from my life in people's fantasies. It's frighteningly scary sweet and full of love, instead of trying to walk through the door myself I call for repentance because living on this earth and working at heart is what makes me what people enjoy but like Sephiroth said you can't protect anyone, not even yourself. so i just stop playing and do what you do as a clown i make people laugh at my expense. if you want to fight wars then do it in sports. God's anger is slow because his love for people is great, he is patient and full of mercy and have mercy on those who fear him. think of a paradise for the people who come after you and act accordingly, protect nature and animals and treat people with charity, teach them with charity. Judge righteously and keep the Holy Commandments of God they are Good and Holy. Pray praise God for this world he created out of love. treat your neighbor as a brother and sister. Whoever has power is responsible for the welfare of people, animals and the planet. Genetic food tastes like nothing. Your hoarded gold will do you no good on the day of judgment. should I ask that you be spared? it's not hard to do the right thing. remember the woman who donated her whole week's wages. Yeshua is the way, truth and life.
