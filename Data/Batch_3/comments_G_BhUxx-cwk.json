So after months of manipulation, arguments and more but still remaining friends with them on July 26th 2021 I tried to take my own life, I couldn’t bring myself to actually do it as when I was about to one of my family members came into the room, about an hour after this I messaged them telling them what had just happened and asking for me to distance myself from them a bit because I genuinely couldn’t handle feeling like this anymore they didn’t care and preceded to ignore what I said and change the subject.\n\nFast forward a month later and we are still friends, and on august 16th they told me they had just gotten a girlfriend, and of course because it had been 5 months and I still wasn’t over them I remember crying myself to sleep that night. After this I had to sit there and constantly here them talking about their girlfriend (they knew I wasn’t over them) and I now realise they were very obviously trying to make me jealous, I just wasn’t able to realise it then, which obviously just made my mental state even worse.\n\nOctober 13th I met someone online who I quickly became friends with as we hit it off and he was the person who finally broke me out of my fucked up mental state and helped me get over my ex as about a month after we started dating, he now helps me try to heal from all that happened last year and is very careful and gentle with me as he knows how much my last relationship damaged me, and I’ve realised I love him 1000 times more than I did my ex even when we were together and I honestly couldn’t be happier.\n\nAlthough once getting over them I finally realised how shitty they actually treated me, the way they treated me while even when were were dating I later found out is a form of mental abuse, I won’t go into what they did to me as this comment is already way to long and I wouldn’t be able to summerise everything in one paragraph.\n\nI am now no longer friends with them and karma has clearly finally hit them and their now paying the price for how they treated me and are getting made fun of at school and getting treated exactly how they treated me, and no I don’t feel bad, I’m honestly happy about it.\n\nSorry this comment is so long i honestly didn’t mean for it to me but my point is this song came out a few days after I attempted so whenever I listen to it I constantly feel like it was *made for me*, and every single lyric summerises all the emotions I wasn’t able to put into words \n\n-Evie <3\n\nUpdate: me and him have broken sadly but I still have so much love for him and honestly don’t see myself getting over him any time soon", "Bill you still miss X😇", "https://youtu.be/x6bxucOyCUQ", "OBRA DE ARTE.", "😒🪞", "Your videos never fail to entertain us ❤️", "Love you Bille 💚😄", "Amazing🤩😍", "Omggg I'm inlove with this song👌", "So Depressing.
