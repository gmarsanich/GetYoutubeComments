I really have never seen an idol do what you’ve done before, and this is a huge reason why you grabbed my attention immediately. I want to first start by addressing your musicality. I love your voice when you rap, because it is so powerful and light at the same time. The contrast between the daintiness and delicacy of your voice and the lyrics that you rap is simply astonishing. You possess so much individuality in this sense. You bring a new sound to every Twice track with your fresh raps and the different ways in which you can fluctuate your voice. Similarly to your raps, your singing voice is so soft and pure. I love that you don’t over-exert your voice, and it sounds so natural when you sing. You are so genuine and heartfelt; and it makes us feel like we are getting to listen to what you’re feeling. I can see you getting lost in the music when you sing, and the stories that you tell to us through your voice are so believable. Your voice, as a whole, is limitless; and you’ve increasingly become one of the most fluid and diverse vocalists to share music. On top of all of all of this, it is impossible to take our eyes off of you when you dance because you move with such swiftness and technique. You dance with such personal expression and it allows you to present yourself artistically to your Once in your own way. You treat each move delicately and tenderly, and represent each concept impressionably with your authentic style. You give just the right amount of emphasis on each movement and highlight the peak of each choreography. You demonstrate what distinguishes Twice’s choreographies from that of other groups, and it is so enlightening getting to see you personalize this beloved art form. You are one of the most talented and refreshing artist who have ever come to be. You go where others have not gone, and because of this, we’re getting a new sound and vision that the world has never gotten before. Your sense is entirely yours alone and there is no telling how it will continue to change how music can be defined and created. Thank you for being a part of some of the most timeless music that we’ve gotten to experience. In addition your musicality, I also admire and cherish your personality. I believe one of the first qualities I noticed you possessed was this warmth. You are just so friendly to everybody and I can see that people naturally are attracted to your openness and willingness to accept them as is. I love that you are so goofy and fun-loving, and are always at the center of many cherished moments. You have charmed so many people just by being yourself, and perhaps it is your members who you have impacted in this way the most. I realize that they are comfortable being exactly who they are around you, and they don’t have to change because you accept them as they come. I see how easily that they laugh when they are around you and you can help them to enjoy life no matter what situation that they’re in. Knowing them for so long has allowed you to personally know what they all like, and you know just what to do cheer them up again. When they feel like they need to confide in somebody, you are who they can turn to because you are such a patient listener. You heal your members by offering them relief in their busy lives that they can’t get anywhere else. Given the way they carry themselves today, it can be said that they might not be where they are today if they had never met you. You’ve given them the greatest love possible and been the best person they could have met to help them grow. You are somebody who they can always thank for being there for some of the greatest memories of their lives. Thank you for changing their lives in the best of ways. Your Once are also fortunate enough to hold a very sacred part of your heart. I love how you open up your world to your Once and invite them into your everyday lifestyle. The activities that you engage in could be kept private or done by yourself, but you include your Once in these events very often. I believe that you strive to give us a piece of you in any way that you can so that we do feel like we are always with you. I also feel like you trust your Once enough to completely be yourself around them. I feel like that you are always your most artistic and creative when you are around your Once, and you really seem to get a lot of motivation from us as well. For instance, your fashion sense is one of the most innovative that I’ve ever seen. You dress yourself up in a way that is completely different from all else around you, and I believe that you gain enough confidence to express yourself around those who love you the most. You’ve always been so honest with us and there is no secret about how you’re feeling because you want your Once to know how you’ve changed from one day to the next. It really does feel like we are partaking in your evolution and you are documenting it for us every step of the way. It is an honor to be the ones who get to be by your side while you take the road you are on. You are the reason so many Once can believe in themselves today, and you are family to those who need it. Thank you for protecting our feelings and always looking our for our well being. Thank you, as well as with your members, for completely changing our lives and helping us see the beauty in life. I want to personally thank your family for raising you and helping you become the delightful and selfless young woman you are today. I know your family is likely the biggest reason why you were able to follow your heart and do what you’ve set out to do. I also know that you’ve kept them with you for the entirety of your time with Twice, and just in general. I’m sure you already know this, but I just want you to never forget your family and that they are always waiting for you.  When you feel lost, and like there is nobody who understands you, remember that your family does and always will. They love and support you more than anybody else in this world does, and just when you think you’re alone, you have them to pick you back up again. I can only imagine how they must feel to see how wise you’ve become and to see how you help so many others in this world. Remember that no matter what you do, they will always be proud of you and every action that you take honors them. You reflect your family with the way you choose to live your life, and I know that they are so blessed to have you. As Once, we want to thank your family and we keep them in our hearts as you do. We strive to spread the same acceptance and generosity in the world as you do, and as they do as well. I know that you’ve been through a lot, both professionally, and personally. We don’t even know the half of what you’ve been through, or how you might have felt during these times. On behalf of all of your loved ones, I want to state just how proud we are of you for making it past all of these hardships. It takes an undeniable amount of strength and a lot of resilience to make it past all that you have. It is impressive enough to come out on the other side, but you triumph over these struggles and learn from them as well. It takes a lot of courage to look at your difficult moments and take positivity and opportunity from them. You have taught your Once, and the rest of the world that there is strength in numbers. With your members by your side, you’ve been able to rid of what has once ailed you. You teach us that as long as we put faith in our loved ones, we will be okay and see a brighter day. Thank you for teaching us how to deal with our problems and how we can rise above them. You have so much perseverance and I know that you can make it through whatever you go through in the future. I hope that on this special day, you do all that you set your mind to, and all of your dreams come true. I hope that you know that all of you Once around the world are celebrating the inspirational and remarkable person that you are. We may not be able to celebrate with you in person, but that does not diminish our ability to commemorate your glory and prowess. I hope that you let our love for you lift you up and help you get to the places that you thought were only imaginable. I wish that this day helps you to see just how many hearts you’ve touched and people you’ve encouraged. I hope that the people who surround you also help you to see what a legendary person that you are. I hope that every second of this day is spent with pure happiness, and that it goes down as one of the greatest days you’ve ever had. Please relax and spend this day doing all that you desire! Thank you for sacrificing so much just to make Twice, and your own personal works possible. Thank you for suffering through any pain, doubt, fear, concern, isolation, frustration, confusion, fatigue, defeat, and so much more just to bring any content that you’ve created to life. I hope that you don’t doubt your position or the role you have in this world, because all of your efforts, regardless of how you might view them, change somebody's mood, day, or life somewhere. You are the reason that so many can love themselves and can see their true potential. You are exactly the purity and empathy that this world needs. I hope that you don't feel the need to overwork yourself, because what you give us is more than we could ever ask for or expect. You couldn't show us a greater love and a better appreciation for life. Please don't overwork yourself, because you already do so much for us and you give us more than you recieve! You are beautiful inside and out, and we thank you for all that you do for so many people everywhere. I pray that you and your loved ones stay safe, and find happiness and worth in the future! On behalf of all of your loved ones, I wish the happiest of birthdays to our strawberry princess!
