Late nights at an old playground, now destroyed, laughs with people I haven't talked to in years, birthday parties with old classmates..I didn't know I was making memories back then, I thought nothing would change. I guess it did. I don't even remember the last time I played carelessly with my friends until it got dark. I miss it and worse thing is, those years are not coming back. I let them pass and only now I understand I was making memories that will stay with me forever<3 I wish I had figured it out sooner..", "I come back 18February2022❤️❤️❤️", "4:21", "Good Song", "This is his best song.", "Just saw the 2Cellos version.

I loved that Ed didn't shy away from making a song about Suffolk and I loved that the castle that I used to visit frequently in my youth is featured prominently. Every time I return to Suffolk to see relatives and old friends, this songs on at full blast. \n\nStill don't know wtf he's talking about when he mentions mountains because Suffolk's one of the lowest-lying areas of the UK. But I get that its meant to be about nostalgia for home in general. Just can't help but yell \"REPRESENT\" every time, though, because Suffolk is one of those gems of a county that gets so often overlooked in the UK.\n\nI love all the shots in it as well and how they're often places I recognise. The Felixtowe docks, the banger races, those old pubs down by the waterfront and along the coast, abandoned farmhouses, those cold 5th November nights standing around a bonfire with the Guy Fawkes effigy. so many things I remember going to and climbing on in my youth.
