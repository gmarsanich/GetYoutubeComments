Kalo masalah crack gak masalah, toh crack sekali pas highnote itu. Lain kali agensinya kalo ngasih lagu buat aespa gak perlu terlalu unjuk highnote, highnotnya juga kyk saling unggul-unggulan gitu  terus sambil ngedance sambil ngedance dan dancenya gk perlunya yg banyak nguras stamina. Apalagi kayaknya agensi aespa punya rencana promosi diluar. Perform diluar kyk amerika itu harus live, kalo gak live bakal dipertanyakan. Kalo agensi aespa pingin lipsing mending promosi di korea sm asia aja deh. Di korea punya seribu cara agar idolanya kelihatan nyanyi live tapi lipsing. Entah tradisi/ciri khas dari agensi aespa lagu grup2nya mesti pakai highnote. Padahal mah kalo gaet org awam/publik yg penting lagunya bagus dan publik gak bakal peduli soal highnote gituan. Btw giselle banyak kemajuan. Ningning dan giselle sdh berusaha ngehype penonton dan have fun di panggung. Winter mirip dg aslinya dan paling stabil.\nSatu lagi agensi aespa ini dikenal dg agensi yg punya vokal2 terbaik tapi makin ke sini agensinya malah banyak nyuruh idolnya lipsing. Sementang punya tittle itu jangan disalahgunakan dong. Jangankan live perform festival, nyanyi live di radio buat promosi lagu aja gak pernah lagi, mana tuh pernah aespa dan nct dream nyanyi live di radio, nyanyi lagu mereka sendiri. Nct dream nyanyi live radio di kandang sendiri yang mana juga gak pure live, karena bisa diproses editing. Aneh banget makin lama agensinya.

But the clear situation here is actually the difference in the way their agency trains them. RV/SNSD as an example. Love the girls, but regardless the years in the industry, the groups do not perform the way 2NE1/BP does. Hence we can conclude, years only provides confidence.

Differentiate or do better.  \n\nWhy not just promote that aespa is being aggressive in the western market through coachella? Or aespa bring in metaverse or kwangya in coachella?

Blackpink performed at a big stage when they were a whole lot popular worldwide, and in comparison aespa are fairly new (rookies) with not enough popularity as BP.

SM tends to train artists the way that they're gonna hook the crowd up on em. Plus BP had a huge fanbase in the US at that time, a probably bigger one rn.

Sure, they are both kpop groups and have 4 members, but their music is very different. BLACKPINK's music is more EDM and hype, less focused on vocals (in my opinion), meanwhile aespa is under SM, so naturally they're focused on dance and vocals. BLACKPINK is also more recognized than aespa, being that they're the biggest kpop girl group in the world as of right now, so aespa would probably feel pressured, completely even leaving out the fact this is their first time ACTUALLY performing live (I'm looking at you SME 👀). No hate to you because you were just posting it and there's many more people doing worse, but the comparisons are getting a bit out of hand.

There were at least two or three more 4th Generation Girl Groups who would be more stable and have better stage presence. Also aespa fans, please stop trying to hype Ning Ning as some exceptional main vocal when she can't even be stable on stage. There are at least a few Main Vocals in other 4th Gen Girl Groups who would have been stable at the very least in the same situation. This is SM's fault for lip synching almost all of Aespa's live stages.
