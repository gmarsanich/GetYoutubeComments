"You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be
I've been here times before
But I was to blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me

She's saying: That's ok
Hey, baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touchin' me so to start
She says there's no turnin' back
She trapped me in her heart

Dirty Diana

Oh, no
Oh, no

She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the
Curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree

She's says: That's ok
Hey, baby, do what you want
I'll be your night lovin' thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star

She said: I have to go home
Cause I'me real tired you see
But I hate sleppin' alone
Why don't you come with me?
I said my baby's at home
She's problably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone to
Say that I'm alright

Diana walked up to me
She said: I'm all yours tonight
At that I ran to the phone
Saying: Baby, I'm alright
I said: But unlock the door
Because I forgot the key
She said: He's not coming back
Because he's slepping with me

"This is back in 1989 when he was sorta kinda starting to get weird with the plastic surgery and all his eccentricities. To me, he looks and seems to be at his best at this point cuz he sings the shit outta this song. You can literally feel it. If he’d just stayed who he was at this point instead of going way over the deep end, he’d likely still be with us and giving us a great show like in this performance.

"Here's the lyrics..

You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be

I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me

She's saying, ""That's OK.
Hey, baby, do what you please.
I have the stuff that you want.
I am the thing that you need.""

She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touchin' me so to start
She says, ""There's no turnin' back.""
She trapped me in her heart

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!

Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no.

She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame,
A life that's so carefree

She's saying, ""That's OK.
Hey, baby, do what you want.
I'll be your night lovin' thing.
I'll be the freak you can taunt.
And I don't care what you say.
I wanna go too far.
I'll be your everything.
If you make me a star.""

No

She said, ""I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired you see,
But I hate sleepin' alone.
Why don't you come with me?""
I said, ""My baby's at home.
She's probably worried tonight.
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright.""

Diana walked up to me,
She said, ""I'm all yours tonight.""
At that I ran to the phone
Saying, ""Baby, I'm alright.""
I said, ""But unlock the door,
'Cause I forgot the key,""
She said, ""He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me.""

"John 3:16
[16]For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

Luke 13:3
[3]I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.

John 14:6
[6]Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

Matthew 18:11 
For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.

John 8:12
[12]Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. 

Matthew 4:17
 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

Romans 10:9 
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

Romans 10:13
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. 

Luke 6:27-38
But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, 
6:28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you. 
6:29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also. 
6:30 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again. 
6:31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise. 
6:32 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them. 
6:33 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same. 
6:34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again. 
6:35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil. 
6:36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. 
6:37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: 
6:38 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.


Ephesians 2:8-9
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
Not of works, lest any man should boast.

2 Chronicles 7:14
If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.

Matthew 5:2-12
King James Version
2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,
3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.
10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.

Matthew 24:4-14 
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.
24:5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.
24:6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
24:7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
24:8 All these are the beginning of sorrows.
24:9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
24:10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
24:11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
24:12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.
24:13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.


Exodus 20
King James Version
20 And God spake all these words, saying,

2 I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.

5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;

6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.

7 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:

10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:

11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.

13 Thou shalt not kill.

14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.

15 Thou shalt not steal.

16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.

Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me
She's saying, ""That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need
She looked me deep in the eyes
She touchin' me so to start
She says there's no turnin' back""
She trapped me in her heart
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Let me be
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
She likes the boys in the bands
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan, after the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors, for those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree
She's saying, ""That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you want
I'll be your night lovin' thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
I don't care what you say
I wanna go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star""

It's Dia-aa-aa... come on
She said, ""I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired you see
Now I hate sleepin' alone
Why don't you come with me?""
I said, ""My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright""
Diana walked up to me
She said, ""I'm all yours tonight""
And then I ran to the phone
Sayin', ""Baby I'm alright""
I said, ""But unlock the door""
'Cause I forgot the key
She said, ""He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me""

"🇧🇷💞🇺🇸.*Meu lindo Super, Mega Pop Star, imperador, princípe e rei mais lindo do mundo, você tudo isso muito mais. Seu taleto muito maior podemos imaginar. Esse mês é o mês do meu aniversário vou comemorar, assistido todos clips do nosso rei num único dia. Meu rei te amar é o melhor presente poderia ter no meu aniversário. E meu desejo aniversário ele tivesse vivo. Pelo menos meu coração, ele está mais vivo que nunca. Recentemente Prince falou em seu instagram, para os fãs de seu pai para ajudar o clipe de Thriller a atingir 1 bilhão de visualizações para comemorar este ano o aniversário de 40 anos do álbum Thriller. Prince, você não precisa pedir duas vezes. Seu pedido é uma ordem para mim. Tudo para o nosso rei, ele merece tudo que ele, fez neste mundo.  Além Thriller, tem os clips They Don't Care About Us, Beat It vários outros clips. Pena que ele não está aqui comemorando 40 anos de seu grande e inesquecível álbum, Thriller. Você pode contar com a minha ajuda e ajudar bilhões de fãs do nosso rei. Meu rei, seu sorriso lindo vale mais mil palavras. Meu coração já seu, não consigo para de pensar em você. Você está meu coração, e nos meus pensamentos, e esse lugar só seu!!! Te amo além tempo, te amo além da vida. Você meu amor, é o vicio mais gostoso da minha vida. Minha vida mudou quando eu, te conheci, foi melhor dia da minha vida, quando te vi pela primeira vez. Você para mim grande exemplo e inspiração. Você cantava voz forte, natural, verdadeira e intensa. E assim quebrando várias barreira do tempo. Sua voz forte, marca várias gerações. Quando escutamos sua música sentinto sua essência, não deixamos sua história, memória o seu legado morrer. Cada vez escutamos suas música nós conetamos seu coração. Os nossos corações estão conectados, bater em um só ritmo, ao som lindas canções. Suas canções, e sua lembraças e seu legado uni fãs todo mundo. Quando a gente ama alguém de verdade. Esse amor não é esquecido jamais. Um ser só espalhava amor pelo mundo. A sorte tivemos ao ter grande ser, vivendo entre nós. Ele tem dom lindo, para música e dança. Ser corança puro e generoso. Só fez o bem. Foi um privilégio para quem conheceu ele pessoalmente, para quem viu ele desde pequeno até dia sua partida desse mundo. Eu, infelimente conheci ele, mesmo só depois sua partida, mais para mim, quando eu vi ele primeira vez parece conheci ele, há muito tempo de outras vidas. Agradeço todos dia ser incrivel e maravilhoso ter vivido entre nós, infelizmente pouco tempo, mais suficiente mudar a minha vida e vidas bilhões pessoas ao redor mundo. Ele sempre vai ser exemplo, ser coração puro não via maldade nas pessoas. Por isso te amo tanto, meu anjo lindo. Muito obrigado Michael J. por tudo você fez nesse mundo e continua fazendo atravez seu legado. Mais a imagem dele, ainda  incomoda muitas pessoas, os grande ignorantes, afinal um grande gênio sempre incomodou muito. As pessoas invejosas incomodava com ele é, se incomodam a presença ele ainda tem nesse mundo e seu presença será sempre eterna nesse mundo. Seu legado infinito. As pessoas por inveja dele deixa seu coração ser envenenado, por mentiras faladas contra ele, deixa de abrir o coração pela verdade dos faltos. Mesmo sabendo ele é incente muito continuam acreditanto nas mentiras, só para não assumir que erram e estavam condenando um inocente, só quem tem inveja dele, por tudo ele é e representa para esse mundo. Que pena muitos não valorizado tudo ele é. Hoje choramos, sua falta  nesse mundo. hoje damos importâcia sua atitudes. Saudade dele um dor imença, nem tempo consegue cura. Você viverá meu coração e nos meus pensamentos para sempre. Seu reinado sempre será eterno. 👑👑🎼 🎵🎶. Eu te amo mais que tudo. Te amar é melhor coisa fiz na minha vida. Te amo mil, milhões, bilhões, trilhões de vezes, esse amor é infinito. Te amo, meu menino eterno*❣️💞💗

"🇧🇷💞🇺🇸.* My handsome Super, Mega Pop Star, most handsome emperor, prince and king in the world. His much greater talent we can imagine. This month is the month of my birthday I'm going to celebrate watching all clips of our king in one day. My king loving you is the best gift I could have on my birthday. And my birthday wish he had alive. At least my heart he, it's more alive than ever. Recently, Prince spoke on his Instagram, for his father's fans to help the Thriller clip reach 1 billion views to celebrate the 40 years of the Thriller album. Will do this year. Prince, you don't have to ask twice. Your order is an order to me. Everything for our king, he deserves everything he's done in this world. In addition to Thriller, there are also clips They Don't Care About Us, Beat It and several other clips. Too bad he's not here celebrating 40 years of his great and unforgettable album, Thriller. You can count on my help and help billions of fans of our king. My king, your beautiful smile is worth a thousand words. My heart is already yours, I can't stop thinking about you. You are in my heart, and in my thoughts. I love you beyond time, I love you beyond life. You, my love, are the most delicious addiction of my life. My life changed when I met you, it was the best day of my life, when I saw you for the first time. You are a great example and inspiration to me. You sing, with a strong, natural, true and intense voice. And so you, broke several barriers of time. His strong voice marks several generations. When we listen to his music feeling his essence, we don't let his history, memory and legacy, die. It will be as eternal as time. Every time we listen to your music, we connect to your heart. Our hearts are connected, beating in one rhythm, to the sound of your beautiful songs. His music, his memories and his legacy unite fans around the world. A being just spreads love around the world. We were lucky to have this great being living among us. He has a beautiful gift for music and dancing. Be heart, pure and generous. It just did good. It was a privilege for those who knew him personally, for those who saw him since he was little until the day he left this world. Unfortunately I met him, even after his departure, but to me, when I first saw him, it feels like I knew him, a long time ago, from other lifetimes. I thank you every day that this amazing and wonderful being lived among us, unfortunately for a short time, but enough to change my life and the lives of billions of people around the world. He will always be an example, a being with a pure heart did not see evil in people. That's why I love you so much, my beautiful angel. Thank you so much Michael J. for everything you've done in this world and continue to do through your legacy. But his image still bothers a lot of people, the great ignorant, after all, a great genius always bothered a lot. Envious people are bothered by who he is, and they are bothered by the presence he still has in this world and his presence will always be eternal in this world. Your infinite legacy. People, envying him, let their hearts be poisoned, by lies told about him, they do not open their hearts to the truth of the facts. Even though they know he is innocent, they still believe the lies, just to not assume that they were wrong and were condemning an innocent, only those who are jealous of him, for everything he is and represents for this world. What a pity that many did not appreciate everything he is. Today we cry, your absence from this world. Today we give importance to your attitudes. Missing him is an immense pain, not even time can heal. You will live in my heart and in my thoughts forever. His reign will always be eternal. 👑👑👑🎼 🎵🎶. I love you more than anything. Loving you is the best thing I've done in my life. I love you a thousand, millions, billions, trillions of times, this love is infinite. I love you, my eternal boy. * ❣️💞💗💖.

"*WW2 like war being started to hide WW2 like genocide.  Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and now ​a corona virus pandemic. Corona means crown, and a virus attacking the crown/government is some thing exposing government (2Corinthians4:4).  Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 can only apply to one place on earth.  Research it well to learn who has been behind slaughters for centuries!*   1John5:19 is trying to stop Daniel12:4,2:44,45.  Hitler was an unexcommunicated Catholic.  Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 is orchestrating this assault against humanity, but they are trying to blame it on innocent peoples, Countries and groups.  *Hitler rounded up to go to concentration camps because of a supposed typhus epidemic, and were gassed on the way by vehicle exhaust, or by zyklon B rodent extermination gas.* (h#$%@3n)cyanide.  *Most were dead with in 70 days of being picked up.*  Canada shut down a government minister on a Parliamentary broadcast for inquiring about their concentration camps. 
*Revelation mentions that people should leave the Revelation18:4 group if they don't want to receive her plagues.  (Hello, if you don't want to receive her plagues!)* 
​According to Revelation 18 this group wears *scarlet(Cardinals),* and *purple(Bishops).*  It refers to a city Kingdom (Rome is the only city kingdom in the world), that rules over the Kings of the earth.  Where are the Kings?  The Roman Empire broke in 2 and from those 2 divisions came 10 Countries.  The Pope was the eleventh, but he got rid of 3, and from the 7 he is chosen, and there will be 10 again.  5 Countries on each leg of the Roman Empire.  The (cross or X) is on the shields(British flag, same as Roman shield) of the the Empire, and it symbolizes the ten Kingdoms, and the religious beliefs. According to official writings no one may buy or sell or say a greeting to any one who has left the cross.  The X or cross originates from the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet the tau, which means a mark, both literal and figurative.  In The Bible book of Ezekiel 9, God put a tau(mark) on the people who were crying over the loss of wickedness.  The mark was not for salvation.  Revelation/Apocalypse 13:18 says you won't be able to buy or sell with out the tau(mark) of the beast(Empire).  It is 1 of only 2 things that the Bible says gets you condemned, with no chance of repenting and being forgiven. The cross has been used through out history, including the Egyptians called it the ankh, which was a symbol of power.  The cross has falsely become associated with the Messiah(Christ), and that is where Xmass, and Christmas comes from.  Popes have always had a mitre(triple tiered crown) with 666 on it in Latin (Vicarivs Filli Dei). 
​Latin letters have a number associated with it(like a Roman clock), just like Hebrew and Greek.   Rome has called for mass destruction and sabotage to stop people from hearing this.  Government and Churches working in self interest. The earth belongs to the people collectively.  *1John**5:19** is getting people to attack the people trying to make you free.(Daniel12:4)  *Clear your browser history and cache, and YouTube search and viewing history!  Please pray for me and you!*  Their hate for Acts2:44 runs deep, and that is why Christian nations are committing genocide under the guise of a corona virus, just as Hitler did under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and falsely attacking China. *The last war China fought was WW2, and that was because they were attacked.*  Try reading your Bible and having a scrap of decency!  Study Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 deeply, as people are putting their life on the line for you!  **There is an open offer of 1000 000 dollars to any one who can prove that Rome(Pope) is not the man in the Temple that rides the Roman Empire of Revelation 17,18.  In fact, that is why it is called the ""Roman""Catholic Church.**  Idols on Ste. Peter's Basilica(Rome), show that Rome is a complete fraud (Acts15, Exodus20, Deuteronomy 5).   Revelation17,18 is framing innocent people and businesses, and are going to attempt to get people so mad they will kill their perceived enemies. Governments issue vaccine mandates all over the world.   Businesses face huge fines if they don't comply, but Revelation17,18 causes sabotage, boycotts, protests, walk outs and people quittng, so as to destroy business.  Those trying to Daniel12:4 about 1John5:19. *The Pope and the British Royals were found guilty of genocide, by the International Criminal Court, pre corona. Donald J. Trump attacked the International Criminal Court by the US financial system. (corrupt), and now trying to start war with Russia.*  Revelation/Apocalypse17,18, 1John5:19, 2Corinthians4:4 is waring against God and humanity. Not NWO Daniel 12:4, but 1John5:19 OWO.*  People calling it the NWO, should think, isn't this the same as the genocide and war of WW2, and plague of 1918?  *Think! Copy and share this information!(video record, record in audio, text, or ?*  All the things happening are to hide a Hitler like genocide.  They are attacking because of information exposing them.  ***There is two realities playing out.***  *1.* A corona virus pandemic and a vaccine to stop its spread.  *2.* Corona means crown(government) and there is a virus(information exposing/attacking the crown/government) and there is a computer/device anti virus(vaccine)(which is supposed to protect from malicious computer code) and this anti virus deletes information from your view.  *Trade your digital vaccine pass for a paper one and they lose control!  *Do it!*   They will go in to a frenzy because of this information.*  UK just passing laws to lock people up indefinitely, with no trial, take your kids, force tests, and send to concentration camps. UK has released tender for businesses to contract cadaver services for millions of human corpses.  Mass emergency poison purchase in Australia.  Hitler killed with odorless rat poison. Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 ruled the world for 1260 years. Rome was beheading for observing the real Sabbath(not ((Sun)day) ""lord's day"" lord's day is a clever imposter of the Sabbath.) *A Pope struck a coin commemorating chopping off people's heads for observing the Sabbath.  On one side of the coin was the Pope's head, and the other an Angel with a sword and a pile of heads.  Ste Bartholomew's eve massacre. In the Vatican library is the proof of the collaboration of Church and State enslavement. Urgent necessity, to make the Vatican library completely public, and every nation should vote to make all religious files over 100 years old public, or start paying taxes.*  Through history the Catholic Austrian Royals ruled Germany and the leader of the exterminations was Catholic Austrian Adolf Hitler, and most exterminations were in Catholic Poland, which is now completely militarizing including school children, and German troops are moving near Russia..  Revelation/Apocalypse17,18 eats it's children.  Determining the future by movies, is pure stupidity.  *××Every one needs a 2.5 micron air quality monitor, so you can see when you are being GASSED!xx* (Revelation13:15,18:5,*6*.)   *How could there be a vaccine for a new variant with out testing, that is not covered by previous jabs?*  G7 nations are removing corona restrictions, to regain it by war powers.*G(7) of Revelation.* Who will do the will of God? (*Revelation 18:6*)   *I've been warning for over two years that Rome would start a war with Russia and China to hide genocide.*  Roman Catholic Joe Biden stopped the natural gas pipeline in the US and now in Europe.  This is Rome's war.  *China be on guard of forces invading Taiwan, blaming you and attacking from there.*  Those attacking Russia/China, read Acts2:44,45, Daniel2:44,45, you follow Satan.  *Gog and Magog are in Turkey, Ezekiel38 not Russia.*  Mark of beast(MOB) nations hate (Bible Acts2:44,45; 4:32-35).  Ukraine sinking their own ships and blowing up their own bridges.  NATO has M.O.B. on flag, and goal is war on Acts2:44. *Pompeo says Rome planned Ukraine war for 2017.* Britian's Boris Johnson said, the pandemic is not working, so plan A, war.  Roman Christian militias killing in Ukraine.  *Putin wanted to talk before this happened. Think!*  Germany forbidden to cause genocide because of WW2 extermination, so now they turn their military over to NATO to do it, and mobilizing in Lithuania, according to German media.  *Russian news channels are being blocked in the West, to hide the truth. Free? No, duped.  Think!*  The Pope is the man sin in the(false)temple with 666, and exterminating for generations, yet the *US although it has the largest military, is naked and prostrated gratifying her Papal master, while UK readies her turn.  Most cowardly in all history.  America chose Satan over God.*  I think Ukraine war was started from Poland as the Italian air force was there.  So many claim to know and follow God but will not obey Revelation18:4-8,  *I am not Russian.* So quit attacking Russia!  Canadian, US and British military found dead in Ukraine, from their involvement(many there for months). Poland the site of most WW2 exterminations is mobilizing the entire nation including school children for war, and Italian military is there.  *Roman Catholic Joe Biden says if this message doesn't stop, he'll attack Russia.  I'm not Russian.*  By the way, Ukraine's capital is a Russian word.  British Royals and Boris the animal say ""Plan A, war"", just like WW2.  Don't be a moron, think!  *I helped build America up, so listen!  Rome is plotting your destruction.  She has false prophets claiming you are Babylon the Great, and not her.*  Russia didn't start it.  Why is Russia media being blocked? Father, my God I pray that you make yourself known around the world with powerful events that can only come from you against those siding with Rome.  Corona virus disappears and British/Rome ""Plan A"" appears. Russian media blocked. NATO insignia= M.O.B.  !87",-0.9997,Negative,-0.003799461703873466,Negative,-0.30238470435142517,Negative

"Being rich and famous is not sinful. However, making that a primary pursuit in life is sinful. “People who long to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many foolish and harmful desires that plunge them into ruin and destruction” (1 Timothy 6:9, NLT). “Do not toil to acquire wealth” (Proverbs 23:4, ESV).

The world would have us believe that the only way to become rich and famous is to set goals and pursue them doggedly. The Bible paints a different picture. Consider three biblical figures whose examples speak to this issue:

1. First and foremost is Jesus. When tempted by Satan, He intentionally rejected the opportunities to become rich and famous (Matthew 4:1–11). Jesus devoted Himself to the tasks God gave Him (John 5:19). We are compelled to take the attitude of Jesus, “Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing. . . . He humbled himself” (Philippians 2:5–8).What was the result of Jesus’ humbling
Himself? “Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name” (verse 9).

2. Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers. As a slave, he had no ambitions to be rich and famous. He only did the work that was put before him. In Potiphar’s house, Joseph’s faithfulness resulted in his being put in charge of everything. Later, in jail, he helped his fellow prisoners, earning a trust that ultimately led to his being put in charge of all of Egypt, second only to Pharaoh. In short, Joseph focused on what God wanted him doing, and as a result he became one of the most powerful and famous men in the world (see Genesis 37—41).

3. He was not wealthy, but the apostle Paul was perhaps the most famous Christian ever to live. How did his fame become worldwide and timeless? He simply did what God put him on earth to do: make disciples. He certainly had a claim to worldly fame, describing some of his accomplishments in Philippians 3:4–6. Yet what did he think about these pursuits that would have warranted fame? “Whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ” (verse 7). Paul’s ambition was never to become famous or gather the accolades of men. His burning ambition was to do God’s work and glorify Christ. That was his higher calling.

In Matthew 6:10–20, Jesus teaches us not store up treasures on earth, but in heaven. Then He says, “You cannot serve both God and money” (verse 24). And “Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things [the basic necessities of life] will be given to you as well” (verse 33). That is, stop trying to be rich and famous, and instead simply seek after God, living out His purposes for your life. If God wants earthly riches to come your way, they will.

For those whose ambition is to be rich, the Bible has many cautions. Jesus said that it is difficult for the rich to enter the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 19:24). Material wealth has a way of taking our eyes off of what’s important and eternal. Jesus’ parable of the rich fool in Luke 12:16–21 teaches that it is foolish to store up earthly things and take no thought of heavenly things.

As for pursuing fame, the Bible is equally cautioning: “Those who exalt themselves will be humbled” (Matthew 23:12). Paul says that “a person with a changed heart seeks praise from God, not from people” (Romans 2:29, NLT). James asks, “Don’t you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God” (James 4:4).

Those who are rich and famous often struggle to obey basic biblical commands such as “Be content with what you have” (Hebrews 13:5) and “Do not be proud, but enjoy the company of the lowly. Do not be conceited” (Romans 12:16, BSB) and “Now listen, you rich people, weep and wail because of the misery that is coming on you” (James 5:1).

To be clear, it’s not wrong to have wealth. It’s the love of money that is a root of all kinds of evil (1 Timothy 6:10). But those with wealth should understand where the wealth comes from (God), the purpose for having it (to further God’s work), and it’s transitory nature (see Proverbs 23:5).

Ecclesiastes 2:24 notes, “A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil.” But the same passage clarifies the Source of our blessings: “This too, I see, is from the hand of God, for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment?” (verses 24–25).

We should not make fame and fortune a primary pursuit in life. Rather, we should make glorifying God our primary goal. We love Jesus and obey Him (John 14:15). We follow Jesus, which means we deny ourselves, take up our cross, and follow wherever He leads (Mark 8:34). Jesus blesses the meek (Matthew 5:5); being rich and famous is not usually His plan for His children in this world.",0.9994,Positive,0.2321033696033696,Netural,-0.33658918738365173,Negative
