Kids who just wanted to play and didn’t care about his fame or money. Imagine the school work while in between travelling to various parts of the world paired with jet lag and being pushed to perform ur best and even then feeling like u were obligated not just to his team but the fans to perform. I get why he acted out. He has known nothing but fame since a young age. People after his money or his body. People doing crazy things to be close to him. He can’t walk down the street without people following him or catcalling him. Imagine the fear and paranoia he lives in. Worrying about being attacked by fans or even haters everywhere he goes. This is how it’s been since he was 16. He didn’t get to live a proper childhood. He had to grow up fast. He was probably taken advantage of by adults being so young (money wise, fame wise) being so young and naïve I bet he was pushed into doing a lot of things he didn’t wanna do.
