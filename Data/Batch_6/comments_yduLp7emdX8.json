'They' do nothing at all other than post trailers on constant from other companies, this includes songs. And to add on 'they' are multiple people. \n\n     Now let's take a good, hard look at PewDiePie. He is, single-handly, an original content creator. He doesn't post trailers or music and call it 'original content'.\n\n     The biggest contribution to this is the fact T-Series within itself is a  Corporation not an Content Creator. While PewDiePie is an Content Creator. To add on, an actual content creator is titled 'Youtuber'. Which means that T-Series is the highest sub-count Corporation while PewDiePie is the highest sub-count Content Creator/YouTuber. Hell, YOUTUBE within itself is YOUTUBERS they run off of the actual YOUTUBERS, YOUTUBERS are the inside of YouTube not corporations.\n\n     In conclusion, PewDiePie is still the ultimate king of YouTube.
