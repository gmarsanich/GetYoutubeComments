this song boosted and pushed the urge inside me to learn how to play the piano but i can't really act upon this urge because i don't have any piano and i have so much to learn if i will have the chance so i keep it inside.,0.6059,Positive,0.2,Netural,0.38579440116882324,Positive

*I just wanna tell Ms. Taylor Swift that after the success of All Too Well Short Film it is never too late to release a film about champagne problems. One that comes to my mind is Saoirse and Timothee because of Little Women but probably too much so anyone would be fine thank you!*,0.8313,Positive,0.0888888888888889,Netural,0.24054664373397827,Netural
