Their all still in progress and I have not..started‚Ä¶.actually working on THE game..but I got my ideas!

Uh..idk, someone in this comment section can find this, read it and help with a name based on the idea.\n\nIn the meantime I‚Äôll use it‚Äôs original name. ‚ÄúStealing In The Moonlight‚Äù is this game where you basically work in an office-(pause. Time check: 12:06 am, 3rd period, same bathroom stall I‚Äôm hiding in. Continuing!)-with your pal Tom.(Tom what? No one knows! I‚Äôm lazy so it‚Äôll forever be a mystery.)Tom is HUGE nerd for the supernatural/paranormal, aliens, etc. and has recently found something that peeked his interest.\n\nWhile working, Tom found out this old animatronic made a comeback in the worst way possible. Guess what it does? It starts murdering kids and adults a like.(starting to sound like a bad ripoff of FNAF) It‚Äôs name is ‚ÄúFuzzy Cuddler‚Äù-(Time check: 3:18 and I‚Äôm sitting on the sideway)-he was originally made for children‚Äôs entertainment-(as we all know, an animatronic made for kids goes perfectly well! We seen how FNAF worked out, so this one must work out just as better!)-until he had a bit of an accident-(time check‚Ä¶8:17 am, next day. Friday to be exact cause I‚Äôm not sure when I‚Äôll drop this in the comments.)(Man, I suck at making sure to continue letters. Anyways, time check:  10:25, second period)-with a little boy who decided to get a closer look.(Fnaf has taught us that it‚Äôs always good to go near animatronics.)\n\nAfter that little accident the company that owned Fuzzy Cuddler and his little attraction shut down and threw him out back, unaware that the animatronic had a mind of it‚Äôs own and decided to go on a killing spree. Tom, this dumb idiot, decided it‚Äôd be a GREAT idea to try and catch this thing and show everyone what a monster it‚Äôs become or something. You don‚Äôt remember the details, you were trying to work.(Time check..again: 12:11, third period)You, having a horrible job, decided to come and join him.\n\n(GOD, okay. March 5th, Saturday, 7:35 pm) I‚Äôd really enjoy if, whenever this games demo comes out or whenever the FULL game comes out, you‚Äôd check it out! It‚Äôd really mean a lot to me!
