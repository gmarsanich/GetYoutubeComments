Sharing is caring .Dear friend ,ARE YOU SAVED ? IF YOU DIED TONIGHT WILL YOU GO TO HEAVEN OR HELL?\nThe Bible says: God is holy and heaven is holy which means perfect. God can never let anybody or anything imperfect or sinful enter heaven.\nHave you ever lied once? Stolen once? Hated once? The answer is yes .This makes you a liar, a thief and a murderer according to God. So if you were to die this night you will go to hell because you have sinned and the punishment of sin is death.\n    The excellent news is that GOD wants you in heaven with Him. But as a just GOD, He has to punish your sins. He has provided a way to save you .There is someone perfect who was willing to take your punishment, mine and the one of the whole world.\n John 3:16 says: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”\nSo Christ died on the cross for our sins.\n         \n                        WHAT CAN YOU DO TO BE SAVED?\n1- Admit you are a sinner.\n                                    2-Be willing to turn from your sins and turn to God (repent).\n                                    3-Believe that Jesus died for you, was buried and rose from the dead. Romans 10:9 say: “that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.”\n                                    4-Now through prayer, invite Jesus into your life to become your personal savior.\n                                     5- Pray this prayer of salvation :( Say it aloud)\nDear God, I come to you in the name of Jesus. I admit I am a sinner. I thank you that you loved me so much to send Your Son to die in my place. I believe in my heart that Jesus Christ died on the cross and shed His blood for my sins, was buried and rose again the third day.\nI am willing to turn from my sins .I ask you to forgive me Father.\nI now invite you Lord Jesus, to come into my heart and life as my personal Lord and Savior. Amen.\nNOW YOU ARE SAVED OR BORN AGAIN WHAT DO YOU DO AFTER?                   \n1-Read your Bible everyday to get to know Christ better.\n2-Talk to God in prayer everyday.\n3-Be baptized, worship, fellowship and serve with other Christians in a good bibelbelieving church.\n4-Tell others about Jesus.\n  NB: Congratulations .You have just made the most important decision of your life by accepting Jesus.\n\n TO START TO LEARN ABOUT GOD :www.EnseigneMoi.com\n-www.cfaith  .com                    \n                                                                      -Watch Ron Wyatt Amazing Discoveries Full on youtube.", "Quien más escucha esto y piensa en Jungkook 🙈💓💓", "This song is fire", "tiktok ruined this song.", "Satyyyy", "Proud of you", "Love this song! 🍭🎤🎹🎤🍭", "— This song is so beautiful!
