I've only been wrong once, and that's when I thought I was wrong. \n\n Maybe the world's most thought-provoking one-liner is \"Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway.\" It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, \"Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart.\" Ever looked with lust? If you have said \"Yes\" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: \"God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\" Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise.

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \r\n\r\n   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness.

Initiated by representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), chairman of the Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa, and Rep. Gerald Connolly (D-VA), as well as six other members of Congress, H.Res. 343 garnered strong bipartisan support with 185 co-sponsors.\r\n\r\nEntitled “Expressing concern regarding persistent and credible reports of systematic, state-sanctioned organ harvesting from non-consenting prisoners of conscience in the People's Republic of China, including from large numbers of Falun Gong practitioners and members of other religious and ethnic minority groups,” the resolution condemned forced organ harvesting in China and called to bring it to an end.\r\n\r\nThe latest bill introduced by Cotton, Smith, and Suozzi proposed action items to achieve the goal of H.Res. 343. “There is growing evidence that the Chinese Communist Party has and continues to harvest organs from prisoners and members of Chinese religious groups. This bill will identify and punish CCP members involved in forced organ harvesting. It’s past time to hold Beijing accountable for these heinous acts,” wrote Cotton's announcement.", "Cringe", "i love your vids", "I like your videos", "Are you ok", "Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You\ndon’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made\nall who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin. \nWe lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before\na Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your\nsin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good.\nThe Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly\nHoly to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t\nkeep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by\nhis perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not.\nJesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your\nsin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your\nfaith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised\nfrom death to give you new life; death has been defeated.

Anyone can examine themselves and know that even though yes sometimes we can do good, we also do evil at times, we commit moral crimes, we rebel against God, or as known otherwise we sin. We lie, we steal, we blaspheme God, we can lust and have hate for our brother in our heart, these are just some of the sins more than likely every person on earth has committed. God is loving, holy and God is merciful among other attributes but He is also just, perfectly just. Like any crime sin has to be punished, if God did not punish sin then He would be unjust, He would be corrupt, someone has to take the punishment. Romans 6:23 says: \"For the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord\". This is talking about spiritual death, not physical death, if you die in your sins then you go to hell. There is good evidence that humans have souls, near death experiences are one of those evidences. There is a part of you that lives on past your physical body. \n\n      God sent His only Son to earth about 2000 years ago, His Son is Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the promised Savior of the world, He fulfilled hundreds of prophecies by coming to our world. Jesus was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life and was crucified on the cross as a payment for our sins. God poured out His wrath on Jesus in our place, meaning the justice of God is satisfied and sin is punished. While we were still at enmity with God, God still wants to save us, Romans 5:8 says: \"But God demonstrates His own love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us\". 3 days after Jesus was crucified He rose again proving that His payment was enough and that He was who He said He was, the Son of God. There is real world evidence for the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, this is not just a nice story.\n\n  Scripture tells us to repent and put our trust in Jesus, to follow Him as Lord. Repentance means a change of mind which means to turn from a life following sin to a life following Christ. Salvation is a free gift and it cannot be earned, no one can be perfectly moral on their own, it is impossible, this is the only way to be in the presence of God in heaven. It is important to reiterate that we cannot save ourselves, it is the gift of God for one to be saved. Cry out to God to have mercy on you, plead with God to save you. Ephesians 2:8-9 says: \"For by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God, not as a result of works so that no one may boast\". Salvation is a gift.\n  There is no other way, Jesus Himself said that He is the way, the truth and the life and no one comes to the Father but through Him. Jesus is not just a way, a truth or a life. Romans 10:9 says: \"That if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead you will be saved.\"", "I think brianana was good of being a bad guy 🧟‍♀️🧟‍♂️", "And next time she will get adopted by the good guys huh?☺", "bro the movie hasnt even come out yet 💀", "I’m rewatching this 🤣 it’s funny how Bri puts balloons on the mobs!!", "Awesome adventures, can't get enough!

This is the best news you’ll ever hear. All of us, without exception, have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). And because God is just and will not let sin go unpunished, the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). As a result, that means that as sinners, we will all get what we rightly deserve: eternal punishment, which is called the second death. But the good news is that God is loving and does not wish that any should perish but that all would come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). So He made a way for us to be saved and now graciously offers you the free gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ (Romans 6:23), all while justice is done. He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on behalf of us and pay for our sins on a cross, and He was then buried and rose again on the third day (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Regardless of who you are or what you may have done, if you believe with your heart the gospel ( ^^ which I just mentioned above) and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, you shall be saved (Romans 10:9,10). Salvation is simple and free. It’s not a 12 step program, and don’t think, as many do, that you just have to be a “good person” or do good works to go to heaven. Salvation is based on what Jesus did, not what you do (Ephesians 2:8,9). Believe in Christ, and you will be saved. “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever should believe in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through Him.” John 3:16,17", "I cringed\n\n\n\nEdit: people hate me now.", "video officially pg-13 3:38", "😢 I the uk the Bad  Guys is no’t rlest 😭 so i crn’t woch this videow. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭", "Wow that rocks", "In 0:50 minutes I like how the guards are iron golems", "Awesome adventures, can't get enough!

The things that are happening in the world right now were foretold by the Bible over 2,000 years ago. The New World Order is about to come into power and the world is about to go into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone! \n     John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”\n      We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”. \n     Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death. \n     Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they repent of their sins and put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT! \n     Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.” \n     Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”. \n\n     Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer to heaven. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Repent of your sins and get saved now before it’s too late. John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.”\n\nHere are a couple links for further information.
