And also I don’t think that people should be forced to make the fact that they got surgery done public. But I also feel like as someone with a following of teen girls and boys James should’ve stated that he got surgery ( if he actually did get surgery ) or that he just edited the pictures if he did edit them. The reason why I feel this way is because with all the beauty standards that we have in society, not telling your fan base that you got surgery could make them insecure and make them wish they looked a certain way. Things like this could put a persons mental and physical health at risk. And I’m not only talking about James, a lot of other influencers with an audience basically consisting of young children and teenagers have gotten surgery and claimed it was natural. So I don’t now if he should’ve announced it or not. And btw I’m not a James Charles supporter. I hardly watch his videos and honestly I feel uncomfortable when I hear people talk about him because of the things he did in the past (if you don’t know what I’m talking about, there has basically been accusations of him being a groomer and him sending nasty texts and pictures to minors.
