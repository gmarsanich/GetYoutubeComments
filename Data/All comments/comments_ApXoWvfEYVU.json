Orson Vaillancourt….Mais nous sommes tous sur cette liste …… Mais qui sont toutes ces gens…… dit elle fixant des centaines de photos d'enfant et de bébé trouvant même une photo d'elle à sa graduation l'arrachant en la fixant.\n-Mais c'est moi. Dit elle crochetant au passage de sa main un vieux enregistreur qui reculait en recommençant en démarrant sur un message grincheux\n- Salut Kate si tu écoutes ceci c'est que je suis probablement hélas mort. Je m'attendais à ce que ce soit toi qui remonte jusqu'au source les plus profondes de mon enquête et la vérité Kate est que notre meurtrier est comme nous des personnes particulièrement spéciales issue de famille qui  on été manipulé génétiquement et formé à devenir des agents spéciales… Mais attention Kates Parce que l'un d'eux à réellement mal virées et l'expérience à tournées aux cauchemars et je ne peux même pas te dire ce qui est arrivé dans cette hôpital psychiatrique mais en faisant des expérience sur c'est gens Kates il ont réveillé une bêtes dans l'un deux.  Il ignore quel monstre il on créé mais il est devenu insaisissable.   \n\nEt croit le ou non mais le seul moyen qu'il on trouver pour attraper ce monstre est d'en créer un autre à sa taille mais de choisir un type doté d'une gentillesse et d'une incapacité totale à faire du mal inutilement.

Tu n'as jamais été aussi utile que de ton vivant. Pourquoi avoir gardé ce secret tout ce temps?\nChère journal, j'ai l'impression de manquer toute l'essentiel de cette affaire de meurtre dans mon film et d'être un réalisateur amateur écrivai Isxago Xollan dans son journal intime sur une chaise de princesse sur un petit chic balcon au sommet du chateau qui surplombait la ville de la capitale.\nIl refermait son livre en regardant la lune rouge et pleine dans le ciel. \nLaissant la porte du haut balcon de la chambre d'hôtel ouverte bouger à peine dans le vent de l'air calme et serein en fermant les lumières pour marcher dans sa grande robe de chambre vers le grand lit baldaquin de sa grande suite.\nCe reposant et couchant dans son lit en s'enveloppant dans une piles de couverture dans le grand lit pleines et remplies d'oreillées. \nLaissant le réalisateur dormir à point fermé en ronflant bruyamment.\nEt quelque chose ce gliser et marche doucement dans la chambre de sa silouette noir . Une immense ombre noir qui tenait dans sa main une sorte de longue lame lacéré.  \nRonflant à point fermé et très dure devant les bruits de métal fronter entre c'est lame scintillante sous le clair de la lune qui se reflétait dans les fenêtres de rideau de la chic chambre…   Avant de se planté en hurlant et grognant de bruit de ressort de cette chose horrible qui se débattait contre le lit du réalisateur qui se réveillait en sursaut à côté de James et de Kate Vandale sous les hurlements fixant sur une caméra une chose dans la chambre…\n-Alors c'est pour cela que vous m'avez retiré vite fait de ma chambre et de mon sommeil j'avoue que ça surprend…mais je ne comprends toujours rien.\n-Mais  pas besoin de ne rien comprendre l'important c'est que vous êtes en vie. disait Kates Vandale en fixant l'écran. Vous pouvez remercier James Jones de nous avoir prévenu.\n-Prévenue mais comment ce type aurait pu savoir ce qui arrive. Dit-il alors que coucher sur un lit d'hôpital connecté à toute sorte de machine et de capteur et sensé James Jones transformé à moitié en louo-loup dormait au millieu d'une étrange pièce entouré de médecin en blanc et d'homme en noir.\n-Que fait-il il va bien au moins… Disait l'homme en noir regardant un médecin concentré dire.\n-Si il va bien il dort et il vient de  faire un rêve qui vient de sauver une  vie. James Jones ne mentait pas en regardant cela…Disait Noah ouvrant un document qui affichait dans sa chambre une chose qui a attaqué le pauvre réalisateur…\n-Mais c'est Isxago Xollan le célèbre réalisateur  hurlant l'agent.\n-Chut… il va bien grâce à ce rêve Kates Vandales est intervenue sur les lieux et selon elle il c'est passé exactement ce que James à rêver 2 heures plus tôt pendant qu'il était enfermé ici il était connecté à cette chose et semblait voir ce qu'elle voyait.\n-Vous savez lorsque il va se réveiller et sera très en colère de ce retrouver dans ce laboratoire. Dit l'agent de sécurité et de protection.\n-Vous savez qu'ont vient de sauver une vie et empêché un meurtre.  Ca s'équivaut dans un sens non. \nAlors que entrant armées avec un groupe d'homme et une équipe d'intervention armées dans la chambre d'hôtel Kate Vandale fesait face à une monstrueuse chose dans le noir qui la regardait et ce retournait vers elle..\n-Ne bouger plus au nom de la lois je vous arrête et je tire .Disait elle relevant sont armes vers la chose qui se tenait devant la vitrine et le clair de la lune des lumières de chambre qui flashait dans toutes les sens autours.\n-M'arrêter essayer donc dit la chose devant elle la laissant tiré la chose de tout sa charge vidant le chargeur de son fusil de balles qui percutaient la chose sans réaction qui rigolait et riait même.\n-Vous croyez que ce sera suffisant pour m'arrêter dit il tiré par toute l'équipe tactique courant sous une pluie de balle en défonçant les vitrine de la chambre  qui éclatait en miette se rejetant dans le vide par dessus le balcon ..Laissant Kate Vandale courir après la chose qui tombait dans le vide le long du château Frontenac avant de s'écraser plus bas dans un choc.. Laissant la chose au os cassé et fracturé ce relevé en boitant et reprenant sa marche au loin disparaissant entre les sirènes et les voitures de polices qui arrivait.\nLaissant au sommet du balcon dans le vent la nuit et cette pleine lune la détective Kate Vandale dire.\n-Tu peux toujours courir mais tu ne peux pas m'échapper indéfiniment", "It’s 29 April 2022 and this song it’s beatiful", "Cant.

God can never let anybody or anything imperfect or sinful enter heaven.\r\nHave you ever lied once? Stolen once? Hated once? The answer is yes .This makes you a liar, a thief and a murderer according to God. So if you were to die this night you will go to hell because you have sinned and the punishment of sin is death.\r\n    The excellent news is that GOD wants you in heaven with Him. But as a just GOD, He has to punish your sins. He has provided a way to save you .There is someone perfect who was willing to take your punishment, mine and the one of the whole world.\r\n John 3:16 says: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”\r\nSo Christ died on the cross for our sins.\r\n         \r\n                        WHAT CAN YOU DO TO BE SAVED?\r\n1- Admit you are a sinner.\r\n                                    2-Be willing to turn from your sins and turn to God (repent).\r\n                                    3-Believe that Jesus died for you, was buried and rose from the dead.

I admit I am a sinner. I thank you that you loved me so much to send Your Son to die in my place. I believe in my heart that Jesus Christ died on the cross and shed His blood for my sins, was buried and rose again the third day.\r\nI am willing to turn from my sins .I ask you to forgive me Father.\r\nI now invite you Lord Jesus, to come into my heart and life as my personal Lord and Savior. Amen.\r\nNOW YOU ARE SAVED OR BORN AGAIN WHAT DO YOU DO AFTER?                   \r\n1-Read your Bible everyday to get to know Christ better.\r\n2-Talk to God in prayer everyday.\r\n3-Be baptized, worship, fellowship and serve with other Christians in a good bibelbelieving church.\r\n4-Tell others about Jesus.\r\n  NB: Congratulations .You have just made the most important decision of your life by accepting Jesus.\r\n\r\n TO START TO LEARN ABOUT GOD :www.EnseigneMoi.com\r\n-www.cfaith  .com                    \r\n                                                                      -Watch Ron Wyatt Amazing Discoveries Full on youtube.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCS.
