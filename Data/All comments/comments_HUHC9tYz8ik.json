It is unexpected, creative, and unique. It is also refreshing to see a female in today's music industry who is not being ridiculously overt in her sexuality to sell the music (\"Lost Cause\" excluded). The music is so amazing, it sells itself. Billie also seems to manage to be hypnotically alluring in her voice - while simultaneously being dressed in asexual, bulky, baggy, figure concealing clothing. The compositions are finely crafted and are quite complex in how they are textured. I can see the music visually in my head as a continuously morphing art piece, taking me to something new and different multiple times inside the song -- rather than being repetitively boring, predictable, and uninspiring like most mainstream music. Listening to Finneas explain how they designed their songs is fascinating too. I hope they pop out a new album every year together and that Billie & Finneas do not allow outside influences to change the magic they have going on in their duo.
