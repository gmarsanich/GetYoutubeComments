Because they don't wanna ask questions anymore, they wanna do what other people tell them. Good guys and ex-boyfriends: Don't stop these girls, they're doing a developement and will never return to be good girls again. Girl's just wanna have fun. Don't treat those women with experiences of the past. They don't want these emancipated discussions again. Like Ariana shows in her scene of 'Zoolander': They wanna be sex-puppets, but not be your girl anymore. Now they stick to the oligarchs, bad men, cool and dominant guys, their social media heroes.
