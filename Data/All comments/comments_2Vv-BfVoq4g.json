I lost both my friends (not in death, but to bad addictions and life choices that they made that caused us to drift apart) and all I do is work and play video games. Then I went to my cousins engagement party and saw her brides maid. This girl, I've known her for some time, we're both the same age, our parents have known each other before we were born, and my mom even suggested her as someone I should ask out, which I blew off. But seeing this girl for the first time in years... it just sparked something in me.  No longer did my life feel as depressing. Suddenly I'm eager to accomplish goals that I've been putting off for to long and actually do something meaningful with my life. I then look up her social pages just to get more of an idea of what's she like nowadays and try to understand why I'm interested in her, and I'm surprised to find that she posses tons of the qualities I was hoping to find in a future partner. She's cute, has a nice personality (these two I already new), is spiritual, loves geeky stuff like Marvel and Star Wars, and shares some similar hobbies. She just feels...perfect. I wanna ask her out, but I strongly feel I should work on straightening out my life some more before attempting to start such a relationship.", "Day 69 yy.", "Wow great job this place so sweet and Ed Sheeran perfect thank you very much you sing alone.

I loved her since the day I saw her, 5 years later we are on our own separate way, but not because there was no more love between us, because people sometimes need to separate to understand how love works.\nI learned so much from her, she fascinated me with every words she said. Love does help you grow up, it helps you understand why life is wonderful and so precious. I made a choice of loving her, then, now and forever. Love might be a feeling for some, but for me is more than that, is a commitment, something that you are proud of and something that you can always be happy about. I owe her all my happiness and all my beautiful memories.  I always wanted to see myself getting older next to her, but nobody can guarantee our next day. I guess happy-ever after is notfor everyone.\nI'm not the guy to write stuff like this, but this song really makes me think of her and all our memories that we have together.
