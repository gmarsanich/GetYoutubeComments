Many people in abusive relationships may avoid conflict simply because they are scared. Abuse victims do not avoid conflict because they are happy at the moment, they most likely hate the situation they are in. No, they avoid conflict because they often believe the abuser is in the right and is doing nothing wrong.\n\nBillie in the golden house seems to be depressed. She expresses little emotion. A complete opposite to the area around her, which is glamorous and extravagant. Abuse victims sacrifice happiness for their relationship situation to stay the same. Remember, many of them think, “It isn’t him/her, it’s me.” So, they remain in their relationship, (which they are supposed to be loving) and become depressed. Much like Billie in the golden house. The golden house has no conflict, but Billie is depressed anyway.\n\nShe thinks it’s great, she is supposed to be feeling good, but she isn’t. She is numb. Hopeless. She’s convinced herself the house is good, but she isn’t enjoying it. She’s convinced herself the relationship is good, but isn’t enjoying it. “Why am I not enjoying this house? It must be my fault” ” “Why am I not enjoying this relationship? It must be my fault.\n\n2:01 - 2:27: It isn’t until the door crashes open with water, resembling being crashed with the realization of your partner being the fault in the relationship.\n\nShe reaches the rooftop, and sees how bad the world (relationship) she is living in is. She sees the rain, the abyss surrounding her, and the lack of exit. This all resembles her character finally leaving the golden house, (the stage of denial or believing your partner is in the right in the relationship and you are in the wrong) and seeing how messed up her relationship is. She finally understands where she is really living in. She is living in an abusive relationship.\n\n4:00: Is a beautiful moment. It shows her character happy, she finally understands why the relationship felt horrible to her. It was the abusive partner the entire time. She’s smiling because she understands, and can move on and hopefully find someone better.\n\n4:40: The ending can be interpreted multiple ways: (1) Her going back into the Golden House is representative of her falling back into the abusive relationship. If the Golden House is representative of peaceful depression and denying your partners toxicity, her falling back into the water could mean she is going back down into the Golden House. I find this unlikely. This songs message seems to be about the realization and breakaway from the abusive relationship: with the heavy rock section seeming to exemplify freedom rather than being stuck to abuse and manipulation. Long, grossing cords rather than tight and restrained ones. She also smiles right before she goes under the water, as seen in 4:47\n\nOr it could mean (2) that she will go back to the Golden House, but will have someone to make her happy. The House itself represents relationships, and maybe if she has the right person with her on the phone, she can finally enjoy it. Maybe then, she won’t have to be away from her partner to feel Happier Than Ever.\n\nThank you Billie.
