We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \r\n\r\n   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.", "Legends of barbarok", "THIS WAS EPIC!!!", "Spoke,Zam and Parrot are your only chance to win against Reddoons,I think that Clown also doesn't like him", "Subscribed", "Repent to Jesus Christ \n‚ÄúThis is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.‚Äù\n‚Ä≠‚Ä≠1 John‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠5:14‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NIV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨\nJ", "youve improved even more omg", "Me, still waiting for the first part of the SMP, when it began, and the story of how you got banned.", "RESPECT HISTORY", "SPOKE IS BACK", "am I the only one who noticed that he changed the thumbnail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike if u noticed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNever gonna give you up\nNever gonna let you down\n\n(Don't scroll down or you get rickroll)", "The civilazition name:P.O.G", "\"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life.\" -John 3:16(bible) \"the wages of sin is death\"-Bible.
