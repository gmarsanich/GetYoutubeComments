You would have indulged your senses in every way imaginable. After a thousand years you would have met everyone you'd have wanted to meet, gone everywhere you wanted to go. The mere presence of your loved ones whom you once held so dear would now be a major irritant. you'd have done pretty much everything you'd have wanted to do, so what's left? You could do them again, but they would have lost much of their appeal after you've done them already, let alone thousands of times. This is eternity after all. You'd be bored shitless.

Considering the emphasis on slick guitar solos during that time and Brian May being principally (by his own admission) a rhythm guitarist, it was amazing how much sophisticated sound they generated from three instruments and Freddie occasionally playing piano on some songs. In addition to Freddie's otherwordly vocals they were phenomenal songwriters as well. They remain the tightest band I ever saw on the stage.
