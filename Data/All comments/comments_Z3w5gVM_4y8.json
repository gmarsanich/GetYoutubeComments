Communism is good, actually. There have been some shitty regimes that called themselves communist, but they've been dictatorships, not classless, cashless societies. Communism is a good idea. It's just been implemented in a very absolutist, brutal way in most places. What about Cuba? They're hangin' in there doing pretty well, have universal healthcare, have one of the lowest COVID death rates and infection rates in the world, and provide mutual aid for their most vulnerable citizens. I mean yea, it's not perfect, but neither is the US or Germany or any of these liberal democracies that claim that capitalism is the end all be all but are failing to take care of their most vulnerable citizens or prevent the spread of a preventable infection. Just seems like maybe your take on Communism is a bit overblown.\n\nI'm gonna go out on a limb and guess you grew up in a Communist regime that was brutal and oppressive like early post-war Vietnam or China or Romania or something.
