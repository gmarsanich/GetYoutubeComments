Is that all there is? Certainly not. We’re made for so much more. Your purpose is to know God. After we die, the Bible says we’ll face God as our Judge. Have you ever rebelled (sinned) against God? Examine yourself by God’s Law, the Ten Commandments. Have you ever told a lie? Ever stolen (the value is irrelevant)? Jesus said, “Whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” In God’s courtroom, our sins are very serious crimes. They’re so evil that the just punishment is death and eternity in a terrible place called Hell.\n\nThe Bible says that God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked. He is rich in mercy and provided a Savior: “God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” Jesus Christ died on the cross, paying the death penalty for sinners. He then rose from the dead three days later, defeating death. Hundreds saw Him after His resurrection; it’s no fairy tale. Jesus fulfilled all the prophecies about the promised Savior, written in the Holy Scriptures hundreds of years before His birth.\n\nReligious rites, sacred traditions, or attending church can’t save you. Salvation is a free gift of God that you can’t earn. To know God and have your sins forgiven, do what the Bible says: repent and believe. Trust in Jesus as you’d trust in a parachute—don’t just “believe” it can save you, put it on and cling to it with all of your being. Wholeheartedly commit yourself to following Christ, and turn your back on sin. Then show your gratitude by obeying His command to be baptized. Be sure to also join a Christian church and read the Bible daily. God will never let you down.\n\nneedgod.com", "My favourite song!", "Empty spaces, what are we living for?2\n\nAbandoned places, I guess we know the score, on and on\n\nDoes anybody know what we are looking for?\n\nAnother hero, another mindless crime\n\nBehind the curtain, in the pantomime\n\nHold the line\n\nDoes anybody want to take it anymore?\n\n \n\n[Chorus]\n\nThe show must go on\n\nThe show must go on, yeah\n\nInside my heart is breaking\n\nMy makeup may be flaking\n\nBut my smile, still, stays on\n\n \n\n[Verse 2]\n\nWhatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance\n\nAnother heartache, another failed romance, on and on\n\nDoes anybody know what we are living for?\n\nI guess I'm learning\n\nI must be warmer now\n\nI'll soon be turning, round the corner now\n\nOutside the dawn is breaking\n\nBut inside in the dark I'm aching to be free\n\n \n\n[Chorus]\n\nThe show must go on\n\nThe show must go on\n\nInside my heart is breaking\n\nMy makeup may be flaking\n\nBut my smile, still, stays on\n\n \n\n[Bridge]\n\nMy soul is painted like the wings of butterflies\n\nFairy tales of yesterday, grow but never die\n\nI can fly, my friends\n\n \n\n[Chorus]\n\nThe show must go on\n\nThe show must go on\n\nI'll face it with a grin\n\nI'm never giving in\n\nOn with the show\n\n \n\n[Verse 3]\n\nI'll top the bill\n\nI'll overkill\n\nI have to find the will to carry on\n\nOn with the show", "The truth is that KGB created HIV,AIDS.
