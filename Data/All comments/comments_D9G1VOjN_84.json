Having watched the show multiple times, I want to come back and list some of the detail in the video for everyone who have watched the show to appreciate: \n\n0:04 The Last Drop - needless to say how important this place is in the show; \n0:16 First look of Imagine Dragons in the Arcane universe - and the fact that they actually made it into the show is absolutely amazing! \n0:20 Powder's monkey toy - those who have seen Jinx's champion trailer would know that this is somewhat of her brand. But for others, it's an introduction of the character and her favorite gadgetry. And this exact toy played a critical role in the show; \n0:37 The crying hug sets the tone. These sisters love each other, likely in a difficult condition;\n0:39 Introduction of the \"squad\". For League players, this is where we found out there were Mylo and Clagger in addition to our familiar faces; \n0:45 Ekko also being part of the \"squad\"; \n0:52, 1:32 Ekko and Powder playing together - unfortunately we don't have many scenes of their childhood in the show, but here you can see these two are clearly good friends. It makes sense as their are close in age. \n0:48 and 1:00 This restaurant is where the kids hang out at. They've ran away without paying for fun before - this is just (poor) kids being kids. It implied that the cook has seen these kids grow up. It explains why Vi went straight here for food AND information in episode 5. \n1:04 Four things in this sequence: 1. Vi will be one of the best fighters since she's teaching; 2. Kids in the Undercity stick together and have to learn to defend themselves; 3. When Ekko mentions in episode 1 that \"Vi showed me some moves to practice\", you will have this scene in mind; 4. First look on some of the characters that will end up on the other side of the conflict; \n1:22 I really can't get over how well they animated facial expressions... Just look at this sad smile! This is \"I love you\", \"I'm teaching you to protect yourself because I want you to be safe\" and \"I want you to have a better life\" all in two seconds; \n1:42 Enforcers clearly having a certain level of oppression over the Undercity people; \n1:57 From here we see the sisters start to have conflict. In this particular MV it seems that Powder is attracting unnecessary trouble. That's not the case in the show but it foreshadowed where the relationship is going between the sisters; \n2:21, 2:29, 2:31 and 2:39 These quick shots further portrayed Powder and Ekko's friendship. The wooden sword and the wok hat are what they used to play the game with, the very game they re-played in episode 7; \n2:47 Powder having mental breakdown; League players know that Jinx is kinda insane like Harley Quinn, but this implied that she had mental issue which lead to the final outcome; \n2:58 Powder being completely isolated with this particular line - implying that she will be left alone and not understood; \n3:08 The 3 looks of Powder in 3 different timeline; \n3:12 Jinx vs enforcers - they will all fall in her hands. \n\n\n\nThis show has been amazing from MV to finale.", "WoW", "This hits different after watching Arcane : )", "2:14", "This is great Maybe rap part would have gotten better and made this goated  but still it's great", "My favourite video song", "Imagine dragons?
