I love you ❤️", "YO! \nCongratulations!!!...I'm here just over 5 years later REFLECTING on how MUCH amazing music and hard work Post has done. He's very humble but can we just pause for a second and realize that it's been years since Post was in the common rap stratosphere? He immediately went to outerspace and it's been all gas no brakes ever since. I don't know how he does it & I hope he remembers to take time for himself. I'd like to see Post around for the rest of my life because besides making good music he's just a real and comforting person to hear from. Even if any person had been offered a  handful of the things that Post has actually done I imagine they would be burned out and truly realize how much work goes into it. I think people often just see the success and leave the roses on the doorstep as a foregone conclusion. I'm here to give some roses while Post is here and I am here on this earth to do it. \n\nThis comment will merely scrape the surface as a sample of a much larger platter of things Post has done and what he's shared with the world. I'm no stan yet I just gotta appreciate this man. One day he was just a guy on Soundcloud with braids and now reflecting years on he's worked with so many artists from so many industries beyond just music; working with legends of rap to rock & more, having the Motley Crew video with NASCAR for Lyrical Lemonade, having his Budweiser dreams come true, getting a deal with Jaegermeister, working with Nintendo for Pokemon's Anniversary and being animated & performing IRL to be recreated digitally as an avatar of himself, working with Swae Lee to make Sunflower for Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse soundtrack, touring around the world and seeing so much that I can't even imagine ever even touching. I'd love to spend a day with Post Malone just chilling on a low key perfect day where he just does whatever he wants to do without worry. To just be a part of that at my old ass age of 33 would be a miracle; totally surreal dream come true. Still I enjoy imagining it. They say never meet your idols but Post isn't my idol. I look at him as a man that's like anyone else who just happens to be amazing at making music. It's really not the riches of Post's life that I'm jealous of; it's really just his sense of confidence, his work ethic, making things look effortless when he's doing so much without complaining or tooting his horn about it. People always saying dumb stuff about Post and I don't get it but why care about any of it. Just like what you like and do you. I feel blessed to know Post Malone even as a fan. If I met Post IRL I feel like it would be like meeting up with an old friend from another lifetime. Just spending a boring day with Post is my dream. If music was involved that would be so dope. I just want to see this man before I die. \n\nThanks Austin! I'm so happy to see your continued success and how you have walked your path with grace & an open mind. You deserve all the love you get and although I'm just a random fan writing from a room in the Chicago suburbs on my laptop still in my pajamas I'm just here to leave some digital roses while there's a possibility you might see them. Are you picturing roses in your head? Are they red roses? I thought so. Whatever the case may be you are a brother to me in a sense and I'm poking through this screen to say Congratulations! \n\nPS: Hope you remember how to vacation but I'm sure I'm not the 1st one to say that.
