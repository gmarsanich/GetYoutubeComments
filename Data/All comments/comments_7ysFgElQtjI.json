De stars pour Ados à star Trash jusqu'à finir dans le néant et rejeté des 2 camps. Retour sur un désastre.\n\nÉPOQUE DISNEY\nMiley est la fille de Billy Ray Cyrus. Un chanteur country très respecté dans le milieu de la musique. ( Il avait notamment été sur un des tubes de la décennie passé avec \" Old Town Road\").\nÇa ouvre des portes à miley qui participe à des concours de chants ici et là et qui décroche un contract avec la célèbre chaîne Disney.\nA la clé une série nommé Hannah Montana ou elle jouera le rôle d'une adolescente chanteuse vivant une double vie. La série est un carton et rapporte des millions. Le timing est donc parfait pour sortir son premier album avec notamment le titre \" Party in usa\" qui bat des records de téléchargement.\n\nÉPOQUE TRASH\nMais en quittant l'adolescence Miley veut également laissé derrière elle l'image lisse et tendre de son personnage de série et va s'en séparer le plus possible.\nTout change radicalement. Les textes de ses chansons sont désormais sur le sexe hard-core et les drogues sur représenté par exemple dans le titre \" We can't stop\". Elle tente également de tout faire pour se donner une image \" Street\" en se lançant dans le Rap avec le titre \" Fallin myself\" featuring will I am et wiz Khalifa.\nLes concerts également se transforme en show porno de 1h30 et petit à petit les sponsors s'en vont\n\nL'INDIFFÉRENCE\nAprès avoir choqué durant environ deux ans Miley à commencer à être vu comme une gimmick et ses tactiques ne surprenait plus personne. Les albums ne se vendent plus et l'image a pris un énorme coup de vieux. Elle a tenté de retourné à ses sources avec un album soft pop country mais ça ne prend plus.\n\nCONCLUSION\nMiley a voulu se séparer de son image coûte que coûte et en faisant ça elle s'est crée une image encore plus fake que sa première image", "J", "E chain", "This dude went from country rap music to lap dancing on satan congrats", "I’m trying to get a", "Çok güzel beğendim", "Lol everyone used to sing this", "Best song ever", "🐴🤠you can't tell me nothing 😎", "Old Town Road", "Really good rock song I love it bro 😍 I subscribed and liked the video", "People act like OMG 2019 sooo old, I don't know if I should laugh or cry", "I remember in 2019 everyone would sing this at school it’s so nostalgic imagine what it will be like in 3 years", "i love this song lollllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll", "Anyone still listening to this 🤠", "Wow ✌️😗 Современный шедевр!\nLil nas ❤️", "5ll", "Lofe before Covid man.
