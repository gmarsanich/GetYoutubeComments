Meu rei te amar é o melhor presente poderia ter no meu aniversário. E meu desejo aniversário ele tivesse vivo. Pelo menos meu coração, ele está mais vivo que nunca. Recentemente Prince falou em seu instagram, para os fãs de seu pai para ajudar o clipe de Thriller a atingir 1 bilhão de visualizações para comemorar este ano o aniversário de 40 anos do álbum Thriller. Prince, você não precisa pedir duas vezes. Seu pedido é uma ordem para mim. Tudo para o nosso rei, ele merece tudo que ele, fez neste mundo.  Além Thriller, tem os clips They Don't Care About Us, Beat It vários outros clips. Pena que ele não está aqui comemorando 40 anos de seu grande e inesquecível álbum, Thriller. Você pode contar com a minha ajuda e ajudar bilhões de fãs do nosso rei. Meu rei, seu sorriso lindo vale mais mil palavras. Meu coração já seu, não consigo para de pensar em você. Você está meu coração, e nos meus pensamentos, e esse lugar só seu!!! Te amo além tempo, te amo além da vida. Você meu amor, é o vicio mais gostoso da minha vida. Minha vida mudou quando eu, te conheci, foi melhor dia da minha vida, quando te vi pela primeira vez. Você para mim grande exemplo e inspiração. Você cantava voz forte, natural, verdadeira e intensa. E assim quebrando várias barreira do tempo. Sua voz forte, marca várias gerações. Quando escutamos sua música sentinto sua essência, não deixamos sua história, memória o seu legado morrer. Cada vez escutamos suas música nós conetamos seu coração. Os nossos corações estão conectados, bater em um só ritmo, ao som lindas canções. Suas canções, e sua lembraças e seu legado uni fãs todo mundo. Quando a gente ama alguém de verdade. Esse amor não é esquecido jamais. Um ser só espalhava amor pelo mundo. A sorte tivemos ao ter grande ser, vivendo entre nós. Ele tem dom lindo, para música e dança. Ser corança puro e generoso. Só fez o bem. Foi um privilégio para quem conheceu ele pessoalmente, para quem viu ele desde pequeno até dia sua partida desse mundo. Eu, infelimente conheci ele, mesmo só depois sua partida, mais para mim, quando eu vi ele primeira vez parece conheci ele, há muito tempo de outras vidas. Agradeço todos dia ser incrivel e maravilhoso ter vivido entre nós, infelizmente pouco tempo, mais suficiente mudar a minha vida e vidas bilhões pessoas ao redor mundo. Ele sempre vai ser exemplo, ser coração puro não via maldade nas pessoas. Por isso te amo tanto, meu anjo lindo. Muito obrigado Michael J. por tudo você fez nesse mundo e continua fazendo atravez seu legado. Mais a imagem dele, ainda  incomoda muitas pessoas, os grande ignorantes, afinal um grande gênio sempre incomodou muito. As pessoas invejosas incomodava com ele é, se incomodam a presença ele ainda tem nesse mundo e seu presença será sempre eterna nesse mundo. Seu legado infinito. As pessoas por inveja dele deixa seu coração ser envenenado, por mentiras faladas contra ele, deixa de abrir o coração pela verdade dos faltos. Mesmo sabendo ele é incente muito continuam acreditanto nas mentiras, só para não assumir que erram e estavam condenando um inocente, só quem tem inveja dele, por tudo ele é e representa para esse mundo. Que pena muitos não valorizado tudo ele é. Hoje choramos, sua falta  nesse mundo. hoje damos importâcia sua atitudes. Saudade dele um dor imença, nem tempo consegue cura. Você viverá meu coração e nos meus pensamentos para sempre. Seu reinado sempre será eterno. 👑👑🎼 🎵🎶. Eu te amo mais que tudo. Te amar é melhor coisa fiz na minha vida. Te amo mil, milhões, bilhões, trilhões de vezes, esse amor é infinito.

This month is the month of my birthday I'm going to celebrate watching all clips of our king in one day. My king loving you is the best gift I could have on my birthday. And my birthday wish he had alive. At least my heart he, it's more alive than ever. Recently, Prince spoke on his Instagram, for his father's fans to help the Thriller clip reach 1 billion views to celebrate the 40 years of the Thriller album. Will do this year. Prince, you don't have to ask twice. Your order is an order to me. Everything for our king, he deserves everything he's done in this world. In addition to Thriller, there are also clips They Don't Care About Us, Beat It and several other clips. Too bad he's not here celebrating 40 years of his great and unforgettable album, Thriller. You can count on my help and help billions of fans of our king. My king, your beautiful smile is worth a thousand words. My heart is already yours, I can't stop thinking about you. You are in my heart, and in my thoughts. I love you beyond time, I love you beyond life. You, my love, are the most delicious addiction of my life. My life changed when I met you, it was the best day of my life, when I saw you for the first time. You are a great example and inspiration to me. You sing, with a strong, natural, true and intense voice. And so you, broke several barriers of time. His strong voice marks several generations. When we listen to his music feeling his essence, we don't let his history, memory and legacy, die. It will be as eternal as time. Every time we listen to your music, we connect to your heart. Our hearts are connected, beating in one rhythm, to the sound of your beautiful songs. His music, his memories and his legacy unite fans around the world. A being just spreads love around the world. We were lucky to have this great being living among us. He has a beautiful gift for music and dancing. Be heart, pure and generous. It just did good. It was a privilege for those who knew him personally, for those who saw him since he was little until the day he left this world. Unfortunately I met him, even after his departure, but to me, when I first saw him, it feels like I knew him, a long time ago, from other lifetimes. I thank you every day that this amazing and wonderful being lived among us, unfortunately for a short time, but enough to change my life and the lives of billions of people around the world. He will always be an example, a being with a pure heart did not see evil in people. That's why I love you so much, my beautiful angel. Thank you so much Michael J. for everything you've done in this world and continue to do through your legacy. But his image still bothers a lot of people, the great ignorant, after all, a great genius always bothered a lot. Envious people are bothered by who he is, and they are bothered by the presence he still has in this world and his presence will always be eternal in this world. Your infinite legacy. People, envying him, let their hearts be poisoned, by lies told about him, they do not open their hearts to the truth of the facts. Even though they know he is innocent, they still believe the lies, just to not assume that they were wrong and were condemning an innocent, only those who are jealous of him, for everything he is and represents for this world. What a pity that many did not appreciate everything he is. Today we cry, your absence from this world. Today we give importance to your attitudes. Missing him is an immense pain, not even time can heal. You will live in my heart and in my thoughts forever. His reign will always be eternal. 👑👑👑🎼 🎵🎶. I love you more than anything. Loving you is the best thing I've done in my life. I love you a thousand, millions, billions, trillions of times, this love is infinite. I love you, my eternal boy. * ❣️💞💗💖.\n\nMaiara 💜💙💚❤️🇧🇷💞🇺🇸", "Its 2022 and he is still a legend", "Never been", "te amo tanto mike 😭💗", "我是林孟億在世界永久性非常大量宣傳布施海濤大法師就富可敵國了切記!因一輩子戒律關係也讚嘆耶穌大愛~阿門!", "2022😍😍😍😍😍", "Who Gon tell me Micheal wasn't a crip", "1st April 2022, Friday,  2:47am, Pakistan.", "OMG I MISS YOU 😭😭😭", "Everything he did was amazing and I really miss him!", "The video rings a bit differently post #metoo\nBut still a good song.", "அருமையான இசை!", "Beats of twist and dance only Michael Jackson Sir.", "mike big Crippin out here", "Mishael  Jackson   lLove  youuu💔💔uuuuu Super  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💔💔💔💔💔💔💕💕💕💕💕💕", "Listening 🎧 to this masterpiece brilliant 👍 in 2022 great", "MJ FOREVER💚", "That's a kidnapping charge for ereyone there.", "I was 12 when this video came out!
