That's dope. I don't see anything wrong w/ what Ariana Grande is doing. The Asian culture (K-Pop) is huge right nah. Why not capitalize off of it? The Asian consumer is typically very loyal. If Ariana can make calculated moves and market herself to that demographic then mo' power to her. Sh¬°t, multiple fan bases translates to multiple streams of income. Music is just too much of a gamble nowadays, especially for black artists. I've gone on record plenty of times stating that artists should leave music alone and branch off into other platforms. I'm in the '90s demographic and history shows that folks my age (36) and older are not interested in supporting new music, especially from '90s artists. Our priorities and tastes have changed over the past 15 - 20 years. Some of us are starting new businesses, purchasing homes, creating families, etcetera. We're not the little girls waiting around for Usher Raymond's newest LP anymore. That time has passed. And guess what? It's not right or wrong. He didn't do anything wrong and we didn't do anything wrong. That's life. The music industry is always looking and booking ahead for fresh, new talent. While Usher Raymond was on top of the world, Christopher Brown was right behind about to do the same thing. That's just how it works. Nobody remains number one forever. Hell, Mr. Michael Jackson was indeed the \"King of Pop\" and we all know what happened to him. Even he couldn't rely on music because by the time he was in the clear, the bubblegum pop invasion had already begun. It's a corporate decision. Anyway, I'm glad artists are thinking ahead and starting new businesses. Do you know that there are still a handful of fans waiting around for Dr. Dre to release another _Chronic_ LP? I'm like, \"If y'all don't go someplace w/ that.\" That man ain't thinkin' about no doggon music. Trip though... Would you rather sell $100 headphones (which is a guaranteed sale) or sell $12 music that probably won't get sold, much less heard? 10,000 consumers purchase $100 headphones - you do the math. Most artists make $0.12 per LP sold , after recoupment. If you write then I believe that's $1 to $2 more. 10,000 consumers purchase $12 LPs - you do the math. Nah, no platform is always 100% smooth sailing, but DAMN! Dr. Dre raked in the cash w/ his earphones business. Ms. Rihanna Fenty struck gold w/ her cosmetics line. Mainstream cosmetic lines are indeed a guaranteed sale. Rihanna probably doesn't wanna be boppin' around the stage and promoting music that's gonna be forgotten within a month's span. Darnell Jones and Johnathan Buck released a song back in 2019 entitled, _Understand._ They released that song as a tester to see where the fans' heads were at. And of course they didn't support it. Why bother w/ a full body of work when fans won't even buy a $1.99 single? Eric Ben√©t is doing movies because he knows that the fans don't and won't support his music, independently. Same thing goes for Clifford Smith Jr. (Method Man). Artists would be fools if they waited around for the fans to buy they music. They'd legit end up in the po' house. Anything you give away for free will come back around and fuck you up. A lot of artists see the bigger picture nowadays. Fans of my generation are interested in podcasts and reality tv shows right nah. We're not interested in new music anymore.

Chloe is correct about the music industry. It has been going on forever.  It's another American system that needs to be dismantled. I am an advocate for artists receiving mad money for their creations. Artists should all endeavor to be independent recording under the umbrella of a label that is not trying to steal everything they produce. Fans want to see their favorites perform. They shouldn't have to work themselves to death doing it. The one percent are so effing greedy. They structure everything to their benefit. The rest of us just sit around and act as though we are powerless to do something about how the one percent operate. Too many good artists are struggling, and it should not be that way. Your comment about Rihanna choosing better resonates with me. It was the exact sentiment I had the first time I heard she was with ASAP. When she got pregnant, I felt pain. Ugh!

Many of us do like bad boy, edgy types usually to our disappointment. I can't say if he loves her or not. Maybe he loves what she has built. Loyalty doesn't seem to be a character trait he possesses.

She is no different from the Kardashians-Jenners, Miley Cyrus, etc, they all appropriate at some point, but never would I ever purchase their products. Smart for her to go into makeup, but there are already alot of makeup brands and I only purchase products from POC(black owned makeup brands) not brands that are doing nothing different from the already established brands out there.

She still signed the contract. If my memory is correct, they signed a 1 million dollar 6 album contract as minors, which means their parents signed them off to Beyonce in a horrible basically 360 deal, but we have been heard this.
