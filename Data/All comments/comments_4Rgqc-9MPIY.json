Of these, four of the languages Telugu, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam are the Southern languages. It is an oft repeated lie that Bollywood is the world's largest film industry and it produces more than 1000 films per year. What the Western media does not highlight is that more 500 movies are produced in the South in all the Southern languages. Bollywood produces more than 200 films per year. The rest are produced in Punjabi, Bhojpuri, Bengali, Marathi and other languages. Although Hindi is widely spoken in the North, in South Indian, people like to see content in their own languages, something which only now Netflix and Amazon Prime are beginning to realise.
