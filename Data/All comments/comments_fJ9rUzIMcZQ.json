Il termine lasagne,( anche lagana e lasagna) indica un particolare formato di pasta fresca di grano duro ricavato tagliando in grossi rettangoli la sfoglia di pasta madre. Le varianti delle lasagne più importanti sono due, la sfoglia all’uovo e l’altra di solo grano duro. La versione di solo grano duro è una specialità tipica del Mezzogiorno d’Italia che viene preparata senza uova e con uno spessore maggiore. Invece la sfoglia all’uovo è l’emblema della cucina emiliana, dove la pasta fresca (soprattutto all’uovo) ha una massiccia presenza.\n\nGli ingredienti per preparare le lasagne sono un tuorlo d’uovo ogni 100 g di farina e un pizzico di sale.\n\nPer preparare le lasagne all’uovo, metti la farina”00″ sulla spianatoia formando una fontana e crea un cratere e polverizza tutt’intorno con un po’ di sale e sguscia al centro della farina le uova.Sbatti leggermente le uova con una forchetta solo quanto basta per mescolare tuorli con albumi; quindi inizia a incorporare un po’ di farina presa dai bordi del cratere.Continua a unire la farina alle uova, prendendola dalle pareti della fontana, poi comincia a intridere gli ingredienti con la punta delle dita, fin quando l’impasto  si presenterà un po’ granuloso. Continua a lavorare gli ingredienti con le dita fino a quando avrai raccolto tutta la farina e l’avrai incorporata alle uova.Quando l’impasto comincerà a prendere consistenza, lavoralo a piene mani: tiralo, per alcuni minuti, avanti e indietro con la parte bassa del palmo; staccalo dalla spianatoia aiutandoti con una spatola, raschia i residui di pasta che sono rimasti attaccati sul piano di lavoro e ricomincia a impastare sempre sulla sipanatoia ben infarinata.Dopo aver impastato almeno 10 minuti in modo energico o quando l’impasto comincerà a presentare delle bollicine, forma una palla, avvolgila nella pellicola per non esporla a correnti d’aria e lascia riposare l’impasto per almeno 30 minuti affinchè perda elasticità e si ammorbidisca un po’Prendi dall’impasto una parte e forma una pallina regolare, appiattiscila con le mani per conferirle la forma a disco. Quindi stendi l’impasto sulla spianatoia sempre ben infarinata con l’aiuto di un mattarello: parti sempre dal centro, facendolo scorrere in tutte le direzioni in modo da ottenere una sfoglia dallo spessore uniforme. Quando la sfoglia comicia ad allargarsi, per girarla avvolgila sul mattarello e ruotala di 90°. Continua a stendere la sfoglia fino a raggiungere lo spessore desiderato.", "Freddie Mercury was a crazy drug addict who enslaved short people (no to drugs)", "ਫਰੈਡੀ ਮਰਕਰੀ ਇੱਕ ਮੂਰਖ ਸੀ", "Thought u guys only make rock songs, I guess I was wrong, THIS IS AMAZING! <3", "December 11th 1975, Newcastle City Hall.
