I wish his Marshall Mathers LP album would have had 4 music videos just like his Slim Shady LP album does, I also wish this album of his would have been 20 tracks long also like his Slim Shady LP album.  There's 2 unreleased Marshall Mathers LP songs that would have brought this album of his to 20 tracks which were songs that were going to be called mom and Dear Ronnie or Uncle Ronnie.  That I'm really sad didn't get released on this album of his but when it comes to why he didn't include his Dear Ronnie or Uncle Ronnie song.  Is because Ronnie's family threatened to sue Eminem if he had I guess brought public attention to Ronnie's family if he would have put that song on this album of his.  But when it comes to why he didn't include his Mom song I don't know why he didn't include it or at least why he didn't include the song The Kids which would have been a funny dope song to have had on this album of his.
