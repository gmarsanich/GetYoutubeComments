And I love to fish
I spend all day out on this lake

Today she met me at the door
Said I would have to choose
If I hit that fishin' hole today
She'd be packin' all her things
And she'd be gone by noon
Well I'm gonna miss her
When I get home
But right now I'm on this lake shore
And I'm sittin' in the sun
I'm sure it'll hit me
When I walk through that door tonight
That I'm gonna miss her
Oh, lookie there, I've got a bite
Now there's a chance that if I hurry
I could beg her to stay
But that water's right
And the weather's perfect
No tellin' what I might catch today
So I'm gonna miss her
When I get home
But right now I'm on this lake shore
And I'm sittin' in the sun
I'm sure it'll hit me

Other artists include Kid Rock and Aaron Lewis. I love and appreciate people like this. I dont care for his rap music but I like this and the other Nirvana covers that he did.

"Well, I've been spending all my money on weed n' pills
Tryin' to write a song that'll pay the bills
But it ain't came yet, so I guess I'll have to rob a bank
I guess it could be worse, it ain't that bad
At least I ain't sittin' in old Baghdad
In the middle of the hot damn desert sittin' in a tank
Well, every time the wife talks, a baby gets mentioned
But I'm so broke I can't pay attention
Lord, how it tears me up to see her cry
Oh, I've been spendin' all my nights on the internet
Looking for a clue but ain't found one yet
Just a bunch of Mopars, guitars, and other stuff I can't buy
Well, now Lord, if you can hear me won't you throw a damn dog a bone
'Cause if the Devil shows up with a better deal this old soul's a-goin' down
Oh, I sing 'em real pretty, I sing 'em real sad
And all the people in the crowd say he ain't half bad
Well, they call me King Turd up here on Shit Mountain
But if you want it you can have the crown
Well, I've been sittin' on my ass like a bump on a log
Watchin' Andy and ol' Boss Hog
Guess I ought to get up and go find a job
Instead of sittin' on the couch trying to find the next line
I'm sure there's gotta be a better use of my time
Like figuring out which one of these banks I'm gonna go rob
Well, the name of the game is hurry up and wait
But that ain't putting no food on my plate
Or gas in my car and I drive a Bronco
So Lord, if I could just get me a record deal
I might not have to worry about my next meal
But I'll still be trying to figure out what the hell rhymes with Bronco
Well, now Lord, if you can hear me won't you throw a damn dog a bone
'Cause if the Devil shows up with a better deal this old soul's a-goin' down
Oh, I sing 'em real pretty, I sing 'em real sad
And all the people in the crowd say he ain't half bad

"Well I love her
And I love to fish
I spend all day out on this lake
And hell is all I catch
Today she met me at the door
Said I would have to choose
If I hit that fishin' hole today
She'd be packin' all her things
And she'd be gone by noon
Well I'm gonna miss her
When I get home
But right now I'm on this lake shore
And I'm sittin' in the sun
I'm sure it'll hit me
When I walk through that door tonight
That I'm gonna miss her
Oh, lookie there, I've got a bite
Now there's a chance that if I hurry
I could beg her to stay
But that water's right
And the weather's perfect
No tellin' what I might catch today
So I'm gonna miss her
When I get home
But right now I'm on this lake shore
And I'm sittin' in the sun
I'm sure it'll hit me
When I walk through that door tonight
Yeah, I'm gonna miss her
Oh, lookie there, another bite
Yeah, I'm gonna miss her
Oh, lookie there, I've got a bite",0.9254,Positive,0.4821428571428571,Positive,0.6869142651557922,Positive
