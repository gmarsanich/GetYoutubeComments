"LOCK. YOUR. DOORS. 

NEVER open the door for someone who says they‚Äôre in danger or anything suspicious! ALWAYS call the police!

In the 70s my grandmother was at home, along with her housekeeper, getting ready to go work at the small grocery store my grandparents opened. A man dressed in drag showed up and seemed like they were probably just selling something, but despite the wig and dress you could still clearly tell it was a man.

They knocked on the door a few times and when the housekeeper opened the door to see what they wanted, the man in the dress pulled out a gun while another man with a gun emerged from the car and followed him inside. They held my grandmother and the housekeeper on their knees tied up at gunpoint and demanded to know where the safe was (those days, it was common for small business owners to handle most of their own accounting so they usually had a safe at home with cash from the business.) They told my grandmother that they had all of her children (they were actually safe at school) and they even called them all my name. After they got everything they wanted they told them if they call the police before 30 minutes they would kill her children. 

It turned out they had actually been there weeks before also with the dress and wig, and actually asked my mother who was riding her bike outside, ‚ÄúHey, REDACTED. Is your daddy home?‚Äù He was. So was his gun and military badassery. They left that day.

The men were eventually caught and sent to prison for this and a sting of similar robberies all up and down the east coast.

"Try to fill the missing person's info with the info you are given. F E is Francisco Estrada, the guy that went to check on the sketchy kid. Apparently something bad did happen to him because he went missing.

My guess is that this whole test is his dissapearance. First you get a story of Francisco Estrada calling 911 to a sketchy kid and it ends by him being demandeb by police to help him. Then you get another story of a blank missing person which is obviously F For Francisco and E for Estrada. That part of the story is the beginnning, where he was at work waiting for his shift to end but later on to realize it was all over because as the first story tells it, is has something to do with the sketchy kid who coincidently went missing too.

"""Do you fear god?"" You would be amazed how often I get asked that. And honestly. No. Less there is some subsection fine print on chapter 8 paragraph 29 in the 2ed contract of being able to be alive that dooms you anyway I have done nothing deserving of any ire from god that I have not all ready paid my due to the people I did harm. And no not the i think i did enough kind the person i was making it up to told me I was forgiven but they will never like me. And that is fair some things I did while young. Well anyway the only way I would be ""afraid"" is if god is a dushbag and if so then even being christen will not save you. That's like being a kid and saying if I be good mom will stop hitting me. ""Wait why do you say that so. Matter of fact."" My past is long and depressing my friend.

If I had to take a guess even if you are fully right they don't want anyone with or can make connections. They want someone that will see a member getting stalked and walk away. Someone that can't make problems by falling in love nor care about what some god thinks. Most likely as well it is a trick. The sounds may not be telling you what you got right or wrong. Or it could be you did get them all right. no one knows how smart these alts are. One thing was as well some can have changes so minor it is only in the voice.

"5:04 I appreciate Mark addressing a problem I have with this analogue horror series in particular even if it's for a goof. A lot of the ""deformaties"" that are ""impossible"" actually are, in cases of accidents and developmental or birth defects, perfectly possible for the human body. This series in particular is really bad for that. Scarring and asymmetry in the face is not something to use to freak people out. Like, at least with the obviously warped grandma that one actually IS physically impossible. But, while rare, not having eyes and having the scarring be in such a severe manner is still very possible. The only thing that pushes it into impossible territory is the mouth solely for needing to eat. But that's not the first thing you see, so that still kind of sucks and is too close to just disabled for my tastes :/",-0.9329,Negative,-0.11333333333333333,Negative,0.41031986474990845,Positive
