In this version Mr wolf starts out as a bad guy who along the way learns to be good,  but in the original series he starts out wanting to do good and does so by creating the Good Guys Club and unlike the movie wolf, we actually get to see Mr wolf's criminal file in the book series. Course there are similarities to the book with the movie, the criminal files on shark, pirahna are the exact same and Mr snakes as well, but this version has the ability to Crack any safe.
