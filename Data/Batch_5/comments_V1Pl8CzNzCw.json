For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.\n\n\nEphesians 2:8-9\nFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:\nNot of works, lest any man should boast.\n\n2 Chronicles 7:14\nIf my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.\n\nMatthew 5:2-12\nKing James Version\n2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,\n3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.\n5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\n6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.\n7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.\n8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.\n9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.\n10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.\n12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.\n\nMatthew 24:4-14 \nAnd Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.\n24:5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.\n24:6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.\n24:7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.\n24:8 All these are the beginning of sorrows.\n24:9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.\n24:10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.\n24:11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.\n24:12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.\n24:13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.\n24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.\n\n\nExodus 20\nKing James Version\n20 And God spake all these words, saying,\n\n2 I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.\n\n3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\n\n4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.\n\n5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;\n\n6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.\n\n7 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.\n\n8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.\n\n9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:\n\n10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:\n\n11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.\n\n12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\n\n13 Thou shalt not kill.\n\n14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.\n\n15 Thou shalt not steal.\n\n16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.\n\n17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.\n\n\n\n..,..,..,..,\n........\n........\n........\n........\n.,.,,", "I'm literally listening to this song because my crush found out I like him and he is not talking to me and he is kinda flirting with my besty when he found out😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭", "Everyone should vist this song everyday to reach 2B views ASAP.", "Me and my bestie from school lav billie elish!!!
