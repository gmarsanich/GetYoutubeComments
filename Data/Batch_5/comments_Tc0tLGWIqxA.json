people and I will give the most special thing of mine to a stranger just to keep them from being sad you got this all wrong all I ever wanted is everything that's inside of you you're the one that came after me not me coming after you I turned you away in 2001 in Orlando Florida because of loyalty to a boy you had a duffel bag full of money if I wanted money don't you think I would have went with you instead of staying with the boy that left me alone in the room with you for $100 to get a toothbrush yeah now you know that's real yeah that was me my whole life I wondered who was that boy I don't know how I never put in two and two together until recently the feeling I had was the same feeling that I had for that boy and then I thought and I remembered the life and I everything it was
