Everything.\n\nLike in the beginning when she sings \"I take what I'm handed, I break what's demanded\" it could also be read \"I take what I'm handed, I break, what's demanded?\" which is also what the whole song is about.\n\nThen when she sings that dominos line up and a light wind blows, but we see it as a tornado. For me this symbolizes how small things are big for her simply because she is already at her breaking point.\n\nBut also how when the tornado sucks them all up comes a moment of relief. This after her actually having failed to prevent, stop or protect Mirabel from the tornado. Even in this there would be a release, to be freed from always having to succeed and taking on it all. The freedom that comes with failure to live up to expectations, but this is in contrast of the pressure to live up to expectations and that pressure is stronger than the desired freedom in failing.\n\nThen in the end when catching the rocks and she sings \"pressure like a drip-drip-drip that never stops\" and the look on her face. For me that is a look of resignation, how she feel powerless to change things and how the only option she got is to keep going, otherwise she will fail them all and they might get hurt.\n\nThen there's the line \"watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks\". Hard things doesn't buckle and bend without breaking, hard things break when they bend. Soft things buckle and break but doesn't break under pressure, another way to symbolize that she is soft beneath the surface that she present as hard.\n\nThen there are all the moments of overt and subtle anger. Anger generally a feeling you have when feeling unjustly treated or when something important is threatened, for example a loved one or your image of yourself. We get to see a lot of anger in the intro, before she reveals what's beneath the surface. Mirabel poking is threatening her to face that she doesn't feel confident in her ability to live up to the image others have of her and/or that she feels unjustly treated in never getting to say no nor really getting anything in return for all her efforts. After this the anger is rarely present, during the main part it's anxiety I hear in her voice. A few exceptions exist though, like when she says the word \"blow\" in \"a light wind blows\", this wind is another threat or unjust treatment/burden. And we also hear the anger come back in the end during the phrase \"watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks\". Could be interpreted as she feels like the others (should) see how burdened she is but not caring even if she is at her breaking point, thus unjustly treated.\n\nAnd anger is something that is often described as \"pressure building up\" if you don't have any way of acting on it. In this case \"acting on anger\" could be as simple as saying no or like how Mirabel by the end when she uses her anger of feeling unjustly treated to overcome her fear and anxiety of being thrown out from the family if she stands up against grandma. But if you never get to act upon you anger it tends to build up like a pressure that will eventually explode. So I can easily see how Luisa would sooner or later have some kind of break down or melt down if things had just kept going as normal. Same can be said for Isabella even though her anger and situation express themselves differently and a topic for itself.\n\nOne last note, you could also see how the part with the geysers and how Mirabel lands on one of them as a symbol of her fear that the pressure she's building up is gone blow up and hurt those she care about, thus being constantly on the watch for external threats as well as internal. And this could be why she seem to have a (of lately at least) habit to get going and doing chores as quickly as possible to avoid the risk of a geyser exploding and hurting those she love. This can also be seen when she sings about the drip that \"makes you pop\".", "yay enconto", "*Luisa is my definition of a gentle giant*", "❤️💪", "“I’m pretty sure I’m worthless if I can’t be of service”\nThis song can honestly hit hard even if you're the youngest. Because sometimes when you're the youngest it's real easy to get lost in a crowd amongst relatives. You're just the baby, nobody listens to you or takes you seriously. So you feel the need to be useful, to not let yourself seem weak or incapable, to shoulder as much, because if you aren't useful then you're just a burden... You feel obligated to be useful because you tie your own self worth to how capable you are and whether or not you can be a person that everyone else can rely upon, you never want to seem weak or small because then you're just the baby again...", "I was fine until I listened in depth ….
