Dường như những tiếng bom và máy bay trên trời đối với em, như là một thứ gì đó đã quá quen thuộc. Em chạy khá vội, có lẽ vì em đang lả dần đi vì cơn đói. Như mọi khi thôi, chạy hết con đường này, rồi rẽ phải một đoạn đến khi thấy cây rẻ quạt là tới siêu thị rồi.\r\n\r\nNgười dân đã rời đi từ lâu, em là một trong số những người không kịp di tản, phải ở lại chờ quân đội đến cứu trợ. Cái siêu thị này tuy bị bom làm sập gần hết, nhưng lại là nơi giúp em cầm cự qua ngày. Chà, nay tìm được nhiều món quá, một vào cái bánh mì sandwich pate, vài hộp sữa sắp hết hạn và 2 cuộn giấy ăn. Em hào hứng ôm cái giỏ đồ đầy ắp thức ăn chạy về nhà, vừa chạy vừa húyt chân sáo. \r\n\r\nBùm Đoàng! Căn nhà từng là nơi em và ba mẹ sống hạnh phúc bị máy bay ném trúng bom. Em bàng hoàng. Giỏ đồ ăn trên tay rơi xuống đất nghe chua chát. Hàng chục chiếc máy bay với biểu tượng chữ vạn bay tới, một trận mưa bom trút xuống. Em vừa chạy, vừa khóc. Chạy. Khóc. Rồi lại chạy. Tiếng bom vẫn sát ngay đằng sau. Ra đến ngã tư, cả 3 con đường đều bị chặn lại bởi gạch vụn, hố bom và xe tăng. Tuyệt vọng, em chỉ đứng đó, cười cho số phận bi đát của mình, và tội ác của chiến tranh. \r\n\r\nBỗng có tiếng bước chân như ai đang chạy. Ồ, một cậu bé trạc tuổi em, hình như cũng bị kẹt lại do ko kịp di tản. Em và cậu nhìn nhau. Ngạc nhiên, mừng rỡ, hi vọng, rồi lại tuyệt vọng. Có lẽ vì cả 2 đều biết chẳng còn lối thoát nào phía trước. Em mỉm cười, vẫy tay chào cậu. Cậu nhóc ấy cũng cười đáp lại, một nụ cười đượm buồn. Nhưng rồi em để ý, cậu trai ấy, dù vẻ bề ngoài có lấm lem vì bụi đất, đôi mắt cậu ấy thật là đẹp. Đôi mắt ấy có màu xanh thẳm của đại dương, một màu xanh dịu dàng, yên bình đến lạ. Em ngẩn người như đắm chìm vào đôi mắt ấy, mặc cho tiếng máy bay càng lúc càng lớn dần. \r\n\r\nĐôi mắt của màu xanh đại dương💙", "I had no idea this was by her.
