And it's not just for the people who took it too far, it's also people who do just a nose job or just an eyelid surgery ( Although, when it is to fix some actual deformity/ a wound, I don't find it repulsive.)\nBut after watching this and thinking about it for a bit, I think I know why it is. I like nature. I like animals and plants and how everything is different and unique. I can find something with imperfect features to be perfectly flawed and beautiful. I would always prefer a real plant over a fake plant made of plastic. And to me, that's what you are if you did lots of plastic surgery. You disrespected nature. You spatt on all of your ancestors. You became perfect, and thus, destroyed all of your unique beauty.\n\nThat's how I feel. I'm glad I finally realized why that is.
