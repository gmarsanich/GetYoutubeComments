"Demonic music is an abomination to God. God, Jesus loves you all so much and wants you to turn away from anything evil that would distract you from Him. Time is short, Judgment on the world is approaching. Jesus Christ wants to have a relationship with you. Repentance of any and all sin (cheating, lying, adultery, sex outside of marriage, pornography, using the Lords name in vain...are all sin and must be repented of and turned away from). You may or may not believe in this, but Hell and Heaven are two real places. If you deny God and His goodness and turn to the ""evil one"" satan, you will find your place in Hell. you will experince Extreme torture much more intense then any torture here on earth, and for eternity (that means forever without stop). Satan uses demonic music to influence listeners. DO NOT OPEN THOSE DOORS by participating.",-0.9845,Negative,-0.04807692307692308,Negative,-0.4087446630001068,Negative
