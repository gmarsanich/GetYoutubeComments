Inn Jesus Name, Amen. \n\nMatthew 7:5 New better pregnancy delivery methods. Make sure to have a vagina friend during delivery. So that they dont try and take advantage of you during your moments of vulnerability. With like unnecessary suctioning, cutting and or c section that wasnt needed after all of that. And tell your friends why they are to be their for you during that time. Also grab the waist trainer afterwards. Or something they give one to women, after birth I forget what its called but you can google it. Its basically like a wrist brace for like you sprained your wrist. It'd be lose and it needs to be in a tight spot to help it heal. Not to snap it back into bounce back form. Its for your health like a leg brace. And look into popsicles and or ice for down there. And try and find some pool side donuts things so that you can sit on them afterwards. It may help with the stitches and or what not. Have one friend who can support you as a person while in delivery. Another that can support you vulva so that you dont get taken advantage of. Count yourself in as a person first. So that youre not just bringing in people that you dont even like and or vibe with. And another that take pictures, videos, audios, vlogs, just chilling on the side. They are audio person. And or can take selfies. But really you dont put all your soldiers on the battle field at once. They are the cancers. 4,5,6,7. There are two of them. And they can do a quick google search in the event that should say a doctor and or nurse try and power trip. And or use legal jargon. Not to mention. They walk with the battle after delivery. One of them does. Or both do. And just watch over the baby. The other two you can have two libras with you. They talk with the doctors. If you need more ice chips before during and or afterwards. I know Serena Williams had to get up and fight for herself to get check for a blood clot. And she had to really persuade the nurse to do her job. So much wrong with that not her fault, Serena not the nurse. It should be standard for the nurse. But even then there are // still so much that we dont know. But youre Libra friends will know your medical history. And can tell the nurses. Adn can do the fighting. You shouldnt have to do everything on your own. Or the libras are with the babies cause high Libra's will walk with you step by step. And cancers can do quick research for if that is what you need and also can research a better solution, real quick. Thats all Ive got for now, but maybe some other people may// will speak up about it. Them there experiences. What they would like. What they may have would have liked? Past, Present Future. Check yourself. Know yourself be real with yourself what would you like? Count yourself in as a person and then human first. I hope that helps. Best, X.

Its better to die honest then to live a lie. Sometimes you agree to disagree. They both got to get their honest feelings out at the time. He honestly felt bad and she honestly didnt wanna hear it. Its like What Samantha Jones Says in Sex in The City. \"I had a fever of 103 you can't take anything I said then seriously\". Not that people cannot change and nor mean it. But don't rely and nor debase yourself to rely on burnt out love for affection. \n\nHe wanted to clear his conscience. And she is allowed the years to process it. You cannot rush someone to feel things on your hour. People should not have to feel pressured into forgiveness. It can make it not as much real then. And then neglecting your real and or true feelings for a connection is not the aim neither.\n\nSelf abandonment for a connection is not okay neither. And should not be what you aim for others to do neither. Its not healthy. Its toxic. Im sorry that he died. But when shes ready and she grows through it. The dealing with the abandonment and the growing through the forgiveness will be well worth it. A true forgiveness can inspire others and soften your heart. A rushed forgiveness and or a fake forgiveness and or a pressured forgiveness can harden your heart. \n\nIt can hurt you in the long run. Its not good for you. Im glad that she chose herself. Im glad that she chose to protect her heart. She was dealing with the abandonment already. Shes made song about it throughout her career. And so you rushing back into someones life doesnt stop it. It can mend some fences, provide some answers, heal some wounds, ease some pain. But it doesnt magically make it all go away. It can be a catayst for her growth, health and forgiveness journey that she is already on. \n\nBut you cannot ask her to skip to the end of the song because youre ready. What if she is not. Especially since she was not. She can continue to work on the abandonment and make the necessary changes. Cause it can leak into and affect other aspects of your life. Even without you realizing all of it. And she can actively continue to grow. She talks about her current divorce being hard because \"There are young (alot of) hearts involved\" her referring to her kids. Obviously she doesnt wanna replay and trickle down her generational trauma of abandonment after the divorce from her dad the same way with her kids. She is still dealing with it and being real about it. \n\nYou cannot force someone to chose you and abandon all the other areas of their life that they are already and are currently in the works of being healed. You cannot give up your health journey for someone else's well being. It was a longer health conversation that was needed and he just didnt have anymore time and he waited until he was almost out of time. Like with before she would have to answer the possible questions and or reasons of why without him. And she jsut chose to do that before during and after him while walking in light of her truth. Cause even if she got all the answers she would still needed some time and space to deal with the aftermath. It was abandonment, she didnt know if he was coming back. \n\nAnd you take time for// with what your heart can carry. \"Above all things guard your heart\" -- Proverbs, tHB. I hope that she goes easy on herself as she continues to heal and now grief from the loss of her dad. And if she let him back in and knowing that he was dying and was gonna be abandoning her all over again this time for something out of his control. She could just be signing herself up to be abandoned all over again. \n\nAnd could possibly be signing herself up to deal with all those feeling again. And dealing with grief this time. Thats a lot to put on a person. Especially when they are not yet healed from the first time. Youve got to give people time to grow. She did the best she could with what she (emotionally) had. You cannot fault her for that. And if you fault her for that. And then you could understand how she could fault her dad. Sometimes ventilation can hold up a mirror to some of your very own feelings as well. \n\nI wish her nothing but the best. Happy healing journey. Don't let nobody bully you into health. That ish can make you depressed. And dont let nobody shame you for being depressed. Its just imploded anger from a boundary being crossed. Dont let nobody make you feel bad about being sad for a reasonable reaction// response for a boundary // limit that of yours that they crossed. Emotionally and or otherwise. You are allowed to feel your emotions. Just chose them in a healthy way. Best, X.

Who suffers?!??!?!..... the kids. When you refuse to be swept underneath the rug. 1984. \"Pressure that will drip drip drip never stop\" Enchanto. George Orwell. If you do not yet know who you are in times of peace before the war. Then you are at higher risk of skipping peace during the war. To prevent the end of the war. In hopes of not going back. \"Who are you if you are not of service\" You need to know that before you go to war. How many people keep feuds because what else are they gonna do// talk about if they are not fighting. And so they continue feuds that now having nothing to really do with nothing. Systems get clogged, organization structures get used but are not yet // no longer working. People start being of extremely high risk of going nowhere fast. All so that people dont have to go back to the not so good part. Aren't yet ready to heal from the not so good parts. So that they can go back to only the good parts. Not wanting to move on forward without the good parts. Abandoning themselves and or there possible real growth in which they miss actually meeting crossing paths on the next metronome. So that you can hold on to the past in fear of potentially not crossing paths again. And so in such possibly fxxking up all the other natural parts where the paths organically cross? You deal with your loneliness before you go to war? You deal with your identity and sense of self worth when not of service before you go to war. You deal with your needing healthy and safe space for quite and inner peace before you go to war. You deal with finding other people to talk to before you go to war. You deal with living your life out loud. And finding healthy and safe ways to ventilate your frustrations and navigate your past mistakes to learn life lessons from a life experienced. You dont give up a life experienced for past experiences. You grow through it. And hopefully make better experiences. But you deal with the truths before you go to war. Some people dont like drowning in the stagnation of a corrupt system. Others dont like having to ruffle through a bunch of lies looking for one truth.

Two broken hearts who can break differently but also can heal, differently; sometimes too. \n\nSometimes, people need to be alone to connect with their thought. Get reconnected with themselves.

Let start start \"For the lowly there is wisdom\". \"For the last shall be first and the first shall be last\" -- tHB. But I mean where is the line. How many poeple will return oscars. And how will hOLLYWOOD create newer and better systems. Are you just returning oscars to return oscars adn or are you actually gonna do anything with this justice. How is that guy from House of Cards not in Jail? He's just playing his guitar. Is he gonna return his Oscar? Its not if we start, but are we gonna see this through. I mean wrong is wrong. But I mean you dont wanna start with the rapist and the pedophiles first. Lets not pass the bucket. What wass the real issue. Where is the line? How can we stop it? How can we address it? How can we grow through it? Create a whole new system? Learn from it? Not just keep it in house all the time. People are doing their jobs but their with in regards to people, not just numbers on a spreadsheet, means to an end, like these are peoples lives. Chris said a joke and it really didnt land with the one on the chopping block Jada. Say what you will but she is the one with the hair that fell out. That we really havent seen outside of the house in forever. It was Will's big night and the whole family showed up and the joke really really didnt land on \"punching bag\". Thats what she was in that joke. She looked amazing but even tho you can look cool. Sometimes it still hurts. Its not like she shaved off her head and nobody knew. Everybody knew. Its just balled heads are kind of in right now. But hers is not by choice. She came outside of her house for Will. She most likely didnt wanna be reminded of her hair, her illness, her stress. Just be able to be a person apart from her appearance due to sickness and or stress. But a person who looks good and is here to celebrate achievements like everyone else. But could somebody else over there be like nah nah nah dot say that joke. Maybe not tonight. Someone else can have a balled head and you can pull it off with them. Did he asked Jada too. Its not like they have good history. The joke didnt land. aND the fulfilment got lost in translation. You get mad at people for defending sick relatives and its like where which direction is society heading? You get mad at the John Q's but not the corrupt system? Not the rapist? Not the pedophiles? The bad but not bad is where you draw the line? No this is to talk about when someone does something but bad for the right reasons. When a burglar breaks in and find kiddy porn and calls the cops. But leaves to not get caught. This is to talk about \"When you are a bad guy. But not a bad bad guy\" -- Wreck it Ralph. Because when you have a two parent income and insurance and you still cannot yet afford the treatment then it is not you. It is the system. And as such it is then also the system that we need to address, talk about, ventilate and find some truth towards solutions and trailblazing a new system forward thinking afterwards.

Sometimes you think \"Its love but its not love\" -- Drake. And then if youre like me you think that you gotta leave and go focus on you. Go get centred with you. Or if not that you just need more love. Sometimes its not love. Sometimes its just an environmental problem. And love can make you blind and think that love is the issue and or solution. Do yourself a favour and dont stop focusing on you. In and or out of a relationship. Of any kind. You just might save your life. #anemia #anemicproblems. Its not broken heart syndrome. You just need more iron. \"She is not dead but sleepth. Give her meat\" -- Jesus, tHB. Eat a steak. Eat some deep leafy greens. You may not even be depressed. That sadness can just be low iron. You might not even be stressed. That tiredness can and exhaustion can just be due to low iron. Especially if youve been focusing on your self care this whole time. You might not even have anxiety. Especially if you take time to get right and focus on your emotions. Those chest palpitations and randoms sporadic out of the blue rapid heart beats and stomach pains that shoot within your gut. Your not in fear. Youre not in danger. Youre in a complete and calming environment. That calms you and helps you to remain calm. It might not even be fear or aniexty. It might just be low iron which is needed for food absorbstion in the gut. #braingutbiome. Maybe your spiritual walk is great. And slowly but surely you let everything go. Until it was just you. To check what is wrong with your life. All your passions, interst and hobbies cause your health and good quality of life was more important. Maybe you could handle your life but still needed to make sure that you could handle you in your life as a person. Sometimes its not you. Sometimes its the system. Studying to be a doctor and didnt learn about it (Anemia). Get a blood test. It can also help detect some breast cancers too. Early research stages. Either way For anemia paid attention in health classes didnt learn it. Thought I was a \"frequent flyer\" was in the ER's so often. Doctors didnt detect it. So many different places they said I was find. You ever do your HS math homework in the ER? ... fun. Went right in to my doctor first month in! He said it was fine. PLEASE STOP NORMALIZING HEAVY PERIOD PAINS AS NORMAL. THERE NOTHING NORMAL ABOUT HEAVY PAINS. And normal has a range. Even for pain. There is a range. When you normalize everything you negate actual non normal and you should check on this more experiences. Would could lead people to start to think that they are crazy. When really they are not crazy. The system is not lazy. Its just some people have not yet finished doing there jobs. There is still so much out there to discover, uncover. So for anyone who feels crazy, you may not be crazy. Check your environment. Your relationships, passions, interests, hobbies, etc. It was a hard journey but I discovered stuff about myself. It should not have had to take that long. There should be other healthier ways for a catalyst for a journey of self discovery. As well finding out a diagnosis. Why didnt they teach this? What else then have we been missing? We need to ventilate stories like this? How many other people may think that they are crazy when it could not be them. It could just be a discover that has not been so widely known and or accepted yet. Anemia isnt new. But why dont people make those correlation yet. When it comes to the biology of the body. You need to have seperate areas. But then you have to be able to correlate to the whole body. Inter Independence with your body also. Overall certain part and then overall and certain parts as well. Some things are connected obviously cause it is the human body. And we should treat it as such as well. When you let your brain think of it like this in terms of biology. And then in other areas, like business, science, arts, etc. Then how many other discoveries solutions can also be made. #SOS #games #connection #connectivetissue. James 2:20. Translate Your outlets.
