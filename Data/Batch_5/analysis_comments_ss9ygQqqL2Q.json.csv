"Is something up with her eyes? She doesnt open them and when she does she squints, looks so weird.

Try that without them.

"*Emergency, there are genocides happening like during WW2.  Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and now they are doing it under the guise of a corona virus pandemic. Corona means crown, and a virus attacking the crown/government is some thing exposing government (2Corinthians4:4).*  Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 can only apply to one place on earth.  *Research it well to learn who has been behind slaughters for centuries!* 1John5:19 is trying to stop Daniel12:4,2:44,45.  *Hitler was a Catholic and never excommunicated.  Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 is orchestrating this assault against humanity, but they are trying to blame it on innocent peoples, Countries and groups.  They are responsible for boycotts, civil disobedience, sabotage, and soon to be mass killings like against the Jews, gays, war objecters(war objecters coming soon as they are starting WW3), and other perceived undesirables as in Nazi Germany.  People were rounded up to go to concentration camps because of a supposed typhus epidemic, and were gassed on the way by vehicle exhaust, or later by zyklon B rodent extermination gas with the smell taken out (h#$%@3n)cyanide.  Most of those rounded up were dead with in 70 days of being picked up.  Canada shut down a government minister on a Parliamentary broadcast when he was asking what the concentration camps they were building were for, then later they circulated that he had been fired a year before the event, now said to be the location of the most covid(corona) cases.* Corrupt. 
*Revelation mentions that people should leave the Revelation18:4 group if they don't want to receive her plagues.  (Hello, if you don't want to receive her plagues!)* 
 According to Revelation 18 this group wears *scarlet(Cardinals),* and *purple(Bishops).*  It refers to a city Kingdom (Rome is the only city kingdom in the world), that rules over the Kings of the earth.  Where are the Kings?  The Roman Empire broke in 2 and from those 2 divisions came 10 Countries.  The Pope was the eleventh, but he got rid of 3, and from the 7 he is chosen, and there will be 10 again.  5 Countries on each leg of the Roman Empire.  The (cross or X) is on the shields of the the Empire, and it symbolizes the ten Kingdoms, and the religious beliefs.  Through time nations and peoples have *not been able to sell their goods to other nations with out this mark.*  According to official writings *no one may buy or sell or say a greeting to any one who has left the cross.*  The X or cross originates from the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet the tau, which means a mark, both literal and figurative.  In The Bible book of Ezekiel 9, God put a tau(mark) on the people who were crying over the loss of wickedness.  *The mark was not for salvation.  Revelation/Apocalypse **13:18** says you won't be able to buy or sell with out the tau(mark) of the beast(Empire).*  It is 1 of only 2 things that the Bible says gets you condemned, with no chance of repenting and being forgiven. The cross has been used through out history, including the Egyptians called it the ankh, which was a symbol of power.  The cross has falsely become associated with the Messiah(Christ), and that is where Xmass, and Christmas comes from.  *Popes have always had a mitre(triple tiered crown) with 666 on it in Latin (Vicarivs Filli Dei).* 
 Latin letters have a number associated with it, just like Hebrew and Greek.   *Rome has called for mass destruction and sabotage to stop people from hearing this.  Government and Churches working together in self interest, not in the interest of the people.*  The earth belongs to the people collectively.  1John5:19 is getting people to attack the people trying to make you free.  *Clear your browser history and cache, and YouTube search and viewing history!  Please pray for me and you!* God for warned about these things happening. 
*Their hate for *Acts2:44* runs deep, and that is why Christian nations are committing genocide under the guise of a corona virus, just as Hitler did under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and falsely attacking China saying that they are the ones committing genocide.*  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb-MNi8E-TA   *The last war China fought was WW2, and that was because they were attacked.*  Try reading your Bible and having a scrap of decency!  Some Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 nations have had war every year, in fact there has probably never been a year or probably a month where they were not in a war. 
 *Government mandates vaccine for businesses over 100 people, and then Revelation 18 Church people, sabotage, boycott and quit, thus destroying the business, and your suppressors take full control again, enslaving you.*  Study Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 deeply, as people are putting their life on the line for you!  *Idols on Ste. Peter's Basilica, show that Rome is a complete fraud* (Acts15, Exodus20, Deuteronomy 5).   *Revelation17,18 is framing innocent people and businesses, and are going to attempt to get people so mad they will kill their perceived enemies.* Governments issue vaccine mandates all over the world.    *The President orders all businesses with over 100 people to force the vaccine on their workers.  Businesses face huge fines if they don't comply, but Revelation17,18 causes sabotage(Canada flooding?), boycotts, protests, walk outs and people quittng, so as to destroy businesses.  Those trying to Daniel12:4 about 1John**5:19**.*  Amazing how all these things came a long as Revelation/Apocalypse17,18 is being exposed.  *The Pope and the British Royals were found guilty of genocide, by the International Criminal Court, just before this pandemic. Donald J. Trump attacked the International Criminal Court by the US financial system.(corrupt)*  There was rioting and protests all across Europe just before the pandemic.  *Italy, the seat of Rome was the first place to long term lock down, fill their Churches with dead bodies and the first to enforce the covid vaccine pass.  The Pope had a meeting with mayors and governors from around the world under the guise of environmentalism pre-covid.*  
 Read Exodus20, Deuteronomy5 and Acts15 and see about the Bible's view of idols, and you will see that it is *Rev/Apoc17,18, 1John**5:19**, 2Corinthians4:4 has caused people to break God's law by using the beast's money.  Not NWO Daniel 12:4, but 1John**5:19** OWO.*  People calling it the NWO, should think, *isn't this the same as the genocide and war of WW2, and plague of 1918?  Think!* Copy and share this information!(video record, record in audio, text, or ?!  *All the things happening are to hide a Hitler like genocide.*  They are attacking because of information exposing them.  *There is two realities playing out.  1. A corona virus pandemic and a vaccine to stop its spread.  2. Corona means crown(government) and there is a virus(information exposing/attacking the crown/government) and there is a computer/device anti virus(vaccine)(which is supposed to protect from malicious computer code) and this anti virus deletes information from your view.  Reality 1 is for public consumption, where as reality 2 is for Church and State. (John McAfee, the computer anti virus software owner was put to death(in Spain) to hide this. Think of which reality is really being talked about!* God be with the people of the world as they unite against the beast system.  *UK just passing laws to lock people up indefinitely, with no trial, take your kids, force tests, and send to concentration camps. UK has released tender for businesses to contract cadaver services for millions of human corpses.  Mass emergency poison purchase in Australia.  Hitler killed with odorless rat poison.*
 Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 ruled the world through force until the birth of the US and the French revolution, which ended the Bible's prophecy of 1260 years of domination by Rome.  *Rome was beheading for observing the real Sabbath(not ((Sun)day) ""lord's day"" lord's day is a clever imposter of theSabbath.) A Pope struck a coin commemorating chopping off people's heads for observing the Sabbath.  On one side of the coin was the Pope's head, and the other side had an Angel with a sword and a pile of heads stacked up.  Ste Bartholomew's eve massacre.*  In the *Vatican library is the proof of the collaboration of Church and governments to kill steal and enslave.  Urgent necessity, to make the Vatican library completely public!*  Through history the Catholic Austrian Royals ruled Germany and the leader of the exterminations was Catholic Austrian Adolf Hitler.  *Most exterminations of WW2 were in Catholic Poland.  Revelation/Apocalypse17,18 eats it's children.*  Poland, Australia have WW2 like concentration camps.  *Omicron is a Greek letter like the last letter omega which has the O sound.  In the the original Hebrew of the Bible there are two words את untranslated in all other languages in Genesis1:1.  In Revelation it tells you who the את is.  It has been hidden in the Greek to deceive you, as the complete Bible was in Hebrew and the Alpha and Omega(first and the last) of Revelation is really the את of Genesis1:1.  א(aleph) is the first letter of Hebrew and ת(tau) is the last, and the one represented as את was in the beginning with God.  Omicron is a code word for omega.  Omicron is information exposing the את being changed to Alpha and Omega.  The false Church wars to protect its false doctrines.* Determining the future by movies, is pure *stupidity.*  Every one needs a *2.5 micron air quality monitor, so you can see when you are being gassed!*  Alex Jones is quoting German and Italian sources...the perpetrators of previous genocide.  Brilliant.  *Media not allowing comments is corrupt and no longer trust worthy  *Revelation13:15,18:5.* G7, the seven heads of the beast system, which Roman Church of Revelation 18 rides.  Global corporate tax is really a war on Daniel12:4. *Tax the Royals!*  ;(((?((",-0.9996,Negative,0.007010912698412697,Netural,-0.23841112852096558,Negative
