The bible says the wages of Sin is death. Sin is very dangerous and that is why we needed a Savior to save us from the wages (wages =what is due to someone) of sin. A righteous judge gives a person their 'wages' when they violate the law right? God is righteous and cannot let wrong doing (sin) go unpunished because he is 100% a perfect judge. Wages of sin is death means the wages of sin is Hell. Hell is an eternal place with fire and suffering. God doesn't want anybody to have to pay for their sins on their own because He Loves his creation so much that He sent His only Son Jesus Christ who is the way, the truth, and the life, to pay it for us.\n2,000 years ago Jesus Christ gave himself up for us so that we can be forgiven of our sins committed against God and justified as a now righteous child of God in God's eyes because of what Jesus did❤️. Jesus is the only one who can save us from our sins.\nRomans 6:23 \"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\"Jesus Christ Christ is the only way to God, and The only one that we could find eternal life & Salvation through. 🌟 This Is The Truth. Whoever may be not sure of which way is the Truth, I Promise you will all of my heart & soul that Jesus Christ is the Truth. Any other way will lead someone to Eternal destruction (Hell) because they have called God a liar by denying Jesus Christ as the only way. \nRepent of your sins, turning from them and accept Gods free gift of eternal salvation to you. Come to Christ Jesus our Saviour 😜💘. Believe in who Jesus is, and Believe in everything he has done for you to be made right before God. 🍂🍂🍂 • Romans 10:9-10\n“That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. \n •Will You Accept Jesus Christ Today? 🛐❤️‍🩹(Just spreading the good news of Christ Jesus ) —(& you don’t have to accept Jesus Christ if you don’t want too :))", "This song will never be the same 😭😭😭", "Why did you both broke up please please patch up again I love u both you look so happy together Shawn please", "정말 잘생겼다!!!! 우와~~~", "Wuuuuauuuu que sensuales ambos!!!!...me encanta el tema!!!!", "It's JANUARY 2022, Let's See how many legends are listening to this masterpiece ♡ This track is so addictive ...............", "❤", "WHO IS HERE AFTER THE BREAK UP :(", "2:50\n\"to ya\" <3", "They literally took off their earpieces❤️❤️❤️😭😭😭", "taylor's face lmao", "Bruh it’s the having lil nas x at the show dancing", "This breaks my heart in such a cruel way now that they're broken up 😤", "taylor and bill 🗣🗣🗣", "Their break up proves no matter how strong love could be as an emotion, it'll only succeed if the people involved will be strong enough.
