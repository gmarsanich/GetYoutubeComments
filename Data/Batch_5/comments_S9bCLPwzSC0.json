They were saving up alot to build me a home, a tuition, everything was literally their blood and tears. I had to move to my grandparents house because mom and dad were handling the debts in the city. They finally can afford for me living with them after 2 year of my dad fighting with depression, he couldnt go to work so mom have to carried him through all of it. The next few years they got a little better with financial problems, but things kept going up and down, they fought alot over it too. And after years and years of struggling, finally they bought a house, at that moment, i think life is way better than it used to be, but then mom got cancer. After two years of battling with cancer, she passed away and a few months right before mom's passing, dad went to jail because of some mixed up, so they never had a chance to see each other the last time, at the time, i was dealing with mental health problems so its hard for me to actually talk to mom and tell her goodbye, still my biggest regret ever.

If you wanna go far, go together\" -- African Proverb. \"Be Busy Like The Wise Ant\" -- tHB. Im starting with my truth. Its best when you didnt build it all yet. That little shark. That little lie grows with the village truths. As those grow too. BEDMAS. Youve got to divide before you multiply. Game of Thrones was just the family tea. Politics is just the inter working of friends working together. And or poeple coming together to hopefully fight for what is right// good for the community. gOD in the valley. Im not worried about the oe that I can see coming. \"Save Half For Harvest\" -- tHB. We Build then righteousness based on truth. Its a horrible place to be. But a great place to start. What is hidden peace will bring to you. 1984. Let it not be war. Truth towards solution is what peace can bring to you then too. If you build with righteousness based on truth. There's Hope. You judge me for feeding the emotionally homeless? The spiritually homeless? The spiritually homeless? There is a truth in the fake smile in a crowd that is frowning. \"Your vibe attracts your tribe\". And so if you have to balance it out in the letter that means that you can no longer keep up with the lie. That means that somewhere in the lie your living in an environement of truth. Im not twisting my brain to understand your lies. But the homeless are tired of lying. Most likely to tell the truth of what is really wrong within the homes, the family, that is the foundation of society. \"You wanna know about life, then go to your house in the mourning\" -- tHB. Talk with the ones who can no longer keep up with the lies. Sometimes you just have to say when for the ones who will do almost anything to keep going. The leaves die before winter. And if \"Autumn Refrain\" then who kills of the leaves throughout the harsh winters that they were never supposed to endure. Did anybody account for that when they stopped the fall. The scales need to balance first. So where do you put the leaves to rest during the winter. So that they are not running rabid when they just shouldnt be. Who is autumn VP? Where do you run to? And wher do you put your thoughts, efforts and interest into? That will tell me about you. And then how can you love in an emotional baseline? What about an emotional surplus? You did wrong prison. You did right outside of society. Libraries still need to be guarded. Especially when there is inner peace near. Who helps the ones stock up for hibernations? Who feed the leaves that dont like like they should during the winter season! The poeple need a break and so who is taking over when helping the ones when they should be resting? And or securing a space where they can rest. It still snows in the winter right? With and or without a boss. And so then who then harvest? There are two harvesters for every deck. And so then two CEO's. President and First Lady like Adam & Eve. Are work marriage. Not personal life Marriage. And so then where has Adam been working all this time? You stand on your truth. And so then where did // how did you let the people stand on there truth. Even if it is something somewhere new? Where did you give room for growht? Culture shock? New environment? Growing Pains? Fear? Fright? \"Did you maybe hide the sayings of the dark from the youth\" -- tHB. Cause you wanna tell them before the truth find them. And they fear even you. And they fxxk up any process that you may trying to make. When you want the people to fear you and then it works. And they fear you so bad they have confrontation with calculated promises expectations with no truth brought to you. How do you deal with truth? What happens if they fxxk up? Put people in a place that is good for them and then see who you are dealing with? See what you see. Did you account for the translation in language bearers and or cultures? Born A Crime by Trevor Noah. That man will build an arc. All the africans came together but they could talk but they didnt all understand each other. Equity before the equality. Even J Cole Let the money get to him before he understood that it wouldnt buy him happiness. ATM KOD. You give a homeless man a 100 and then you try and judge what he does with it. Come on he may not even know where his next meal is coming from. He may not even have a roof over his head. Did you teach the man to fish and or risk destabilizing the environment? Did you teach him the beauty of the environment first? The beauty of peace first. Its not everything. But did you make room for how guest can be treated apart from family? What about the proper way for how to treat strangers. If you dont like them then let them go. Why do have someoen that you dont like stay? So then did you try and understand the connective tissue then first. Did you try and understand why that person wasnt there yet. Matthew 7:5. Was that an in house problem? Did you start there; yet? James 2:20. \"Do Not Embrace Ignorance\" -- tHB. Problems at homeland you get mad at the guest. Did you even at least first acknowledge the problems within the house. Is it connected to the guest. Did you address it this way and then maybe send the guest on there way to address the family issue. Or did you just get made at the foreigner? What about the truth? Why are they there? Why havent you gotten rid of them yet? Start with there connection to you? Start with the connective tissue between the mutual friends. Between the common interest. Did you address Jonadab yet? And or the sibling that did the crime yet? And or are you just getting mad at Tamars friend. Pre and or Post Ashened. If you dont like speak truth. You can send them to a better environment. And deal with the problems within the home. Start with the truths that you can carry. \"Do not hide the sayings of the dark from the youth\" -- tHB. Why dont people warn the kids of the spirituality adn or the soulfulness?That your soul can pulled out of your body through sexual violation? Did no one want to warn tAMAR about that first?

Mama out to see me\nBut daddy had to work\nYou and mama had to leave me\nThen you started seeing daddy on the TV\nAnd mama didn't like it\nAnd you and Lainie were too young to understand it\nPapa was a rolling stone\nMama developed a habit\nAnd it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it\nI'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand\n'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud\nNow I'm sittin' in this empty house, just reminiscin'\nLooking at your baby pictures it just trips me out\nTo see how much you both have grown\nIt's almost like your sisters now\nWow, I guess you pretty much are\nAnd daddy's still here\nLainie I'm talking to you too\nDaddy's still here\nI like the sound of that, yeah\nIt's got a ring to it, don't it?\nShhh, mama's only gone for the moment\nNow hush little baby don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up little lady\nI told ya daddy's here to hold ya\nThrough the night\nI know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\nWe fear how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy pretty baby\nBut I promise\nMama's gonna be alright\nAnd if you ask me to\nDaddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird\nI'ma give you the world\nI'ma buy a diamond ring for you\nI'ma sing for you, I'll do anything for you to see you smile\nAnd if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine\nI'ma break that birdy's neck\nI'll go back to the jeweller who sold it to ya\nAnd make him eat every carat\nDon't fuck with dad, haha", "Old is Gold 🔥💛", "Mockingbird", "Mi ricordi tutti i momenti passati
