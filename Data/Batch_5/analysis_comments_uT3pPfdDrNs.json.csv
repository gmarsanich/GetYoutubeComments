"They should have the i quit match at backlash. And then Charlotte should have ronda in the figure 4 lock. Then Charlotte is trying everything she can to make ronda tap but nothing is working. So the lights should go out and nia jax returns and attacks ronda and Charlotte & Nia should put ronda in a double submission like how Jericho & Big Show did undertaker at survivor series’09. Then ronda & jax should fued for a while. Then after mitb, ronda comes out to tell Charlotte that she wants one more shot at the championship at summerslam. But under one condition. The match will be a hell in a cell match. Which ronda should win to end this fued.",0.6486,Positive,0.3,Netural,-0.35999828577041626,Negative

"I can’t see wwe booking Ronda to say she quits. It wouldn’t look good booking an ex mma fighter to lose that way to a wrestling performer.

"I see some horrible comments like Ronda is so bad on mic. Like seriously, did u pay to watch ppl talk or fights?
For crying out loud, Ronda Rousey did what the so-called bests in the world couldn't do
Charlotte Flair and Becky Lynch has been in WM b4. Why didn't any of them main event the grandest show?
But just 1yr in the company she did

All of u are busy acknowledging the so-called tribal chief but to me he's a trial thief.
Some day all the stupid WWE fans will acknowledge the Queen of Octagon Ronda Rousey ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️",0.9657,Positive,-0.3333333333333333,Negative,-0.41048505902290344,Negative
