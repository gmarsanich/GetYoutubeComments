[16]For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

Luke 13:3
[3]I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.

John 14:6
[6]Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

Matthew 18:11 
For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.

John 8:12
[12]Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. 

Matthew 4:17
 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

Romans 10:9 
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

Romans 10:13
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. 

Luke 6:27-38
But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, 
6:28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you. 
6:29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also. 
6:30 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again. 
6:31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise. 
6:32 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them. 
6:33 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same. 
6:34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again. 
6:35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil. 
6:36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. 
6:37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: 
6:38 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.


Ephesians 2:8-9
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
Not of works, lest any man should boast.

2 Chronicles 7:14
If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.

Matthew 5:2-12
King James Version
2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,
3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.
10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.

Matthew 24:4-14 
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.
24:5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.
24:6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
24:7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
24:8 All these are the beginning of sorrows.
24:9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
24:10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
24:11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
24:12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.
24:13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.


Exodus 20
King James Version
20 And God spake all these words, saying,

2 I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.

5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;

6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.

7 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:

10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:

11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.

13 Thou shalt not kill.

14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.

15 Thou shalt not steal.

16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.

Gonna hurt your mind
Don't shoot to kill

And the whole world has to answer right now

Who's bad?
The word is out
You're doin' wrong
Gonna lock you up
Before too long
Your lyin' eyes
Gonna tell you right
So listen up
Don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap
You're not a man
You're throwin' stones
To hide your hands
But they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
And my friends you have seen nothin'
Just wait 'til I get through

"üáßüá∑üíûüá∫üá∏.*Meu lindo Super, Mega Pop Star, imperador, princ√≠pe e rei mais lindo do mundo, voc√™ tudo isso muito mais. Seu taleto muito maior podemos imaginar. Esse m√™s √© o m√™s do meu anivers√°rio vou comemorar, assistido todos clips do nosso rei num √∫nico dia. Meu rei te amar √© o melhor presente poderia ter no meu anivers√°rio. E meu desejo anivers√°rio ele tivesse vivo. Pelo menos meu cora√ß√£o, ele est√° mais vivo que nunca. Recentemente Prince falou em seu instagram, para os f√£s de seu pai para ajudar o clipe de Thriller a atingir 1 bilh√£o de visualiza√ß√µes para comemorar este ano o anivers√°rio de 40 anos do √°lbum Thriller. Prince, voc√™ n√£o precisa pedir duas vezes. Seu pedido √© uma ordem para mim. Tudo para o nosso rei, ele merece tudo que ele, fez neste mundo.  Al√©m Thriller, tem os clips They Don't Care About Us, Beat It v√°rios outros clips. Pena que ele n√£o est√° aqui comemorando 40 anos de seu grande e inesquec√≠vel √°lbum, Thriller. Voc√™ pode contar com a minha ajuda e ajudar bilh√µes de f√£s do nosso rei. Meu rei, seu sorriso lindo vale mais mil palavras. Meu cora√ß√£o j√° seu, n√£o consigo para de pensar em voc√™. Voc√™ est√° meu cora√ß√£o, e nos meus pensamentos, e esse lugar s√≥ seu!!! Te amo al√©m tempo, te amo al√©m da vida. Voc√™ meu amor, √© o vicio mais gostoso da minha vida. Minha vida mudou quando eu, te conheci, foi melhor dia da minha vida, quando te vi pela primeira vez. Voc√™ para mim grande exemplo e inspira√ß√£o. Voc√™ cantava voz forte, natural, verdadeira e intensa. E assim quebrando v√°rias barreira do tempo. Sua voz forte, marca v√°rias gera√ß√µes. Quando escutamos sua m√∫sica sentinto sua ess√™ncia, n√£o deixamos sua hist√≥ria, mem√≥ria o seu legado morrer. Cada vez escutamos suas m√∫sica n√≥s conetamos seu cora√ß√£o. Os nossos cora√ß√µes est√£o conectados, bater em um s√≥ ritmo, ao som lindas can√ß√µes. Suas can√ß√µes, e sua lembra√ßas e seu legado uni f√£s todo mundo. Quando a gente ama algu√©m de verdade. Esse amor n√£o √© esquecido jamais. Um ser s√≥ espalhava amor pelo mundo. A sorte tivemos ao ter grande ser, vivendo entre n√≥s. Ele tem dom lindo, para m√∫sica e dan√ßa. Ser coran√ßa puro e generoso. S√≥ fez o bem. Foi um privil√©gio para quem conheceu ele pessoalmente, para quem viu ele desde pequeno at√© dia sua partida desse mundo. Eu, infelimente conheci ele, mesmo s√≥ depois sua partida, mais para mim, quando eu vi ele primeira vez parece conheci ele, h√° muito tempo de outras vidas. Agrade√ßo todos dia ser incrivel e maravilhoso ter vivido entre n√≥s, infelizmente pouco tempo, mais suficiente mudar a minha vida e vidas bilh√µes pessoas ao redor mundo. Ele sempre vai ser exemplo, ser cora√ß√£o puro n√£o via maldade nas pessoas. Por isso te amo tanto, meu anjo lindo. Muito obrigado Michael J. por tudo voc√™ fez nesse mundo e continua fazendo atravez seu legado. Mais a imagem dele, ainda  incomoda muitas pessoas, os grande ignorantes, afinal um grande g√™nio sempre incomodou muito. As pessoas invejosas incomodava com ele √©, se incomodam a presen√ßa ele ainda tem nesse mundo e seu presen√ßa ser√° sempre eterna nesse mundo. Seu legado infinito.

"üáßüá∑üíûüá∫üá∏.* My handsome Super, Mega Pop Star, most handsome emperor, prince and king in the world. His much greater talent we can imagine. This month is the month of my birthday I'm going to celebrate watching all clips of our king in one day. My king loving you is the best gift I could have on my birthday. And my birthday wish he had alive. At least my heart he, it's more alive than ever. Recently, Prince spoke on his Instagram, for his father's fans to help the Thriller clip reach 1 billion views to celebrate the 40 years of the Thriller album. Will do this year. Prince, you don't have to ask twice. Your order is an order to me. Everything for our king, he deserves everything he's done in this world. In addition to Thriller, there are also clips They Don't Care About Us, Beat It and several other clips. Too bad he's not here celebrating 40 years of his great and unforgettable album, Thriller. You can count on my help and help billions of fans of our king. My king, your beautiful smile is worth a thousand words. My heart is already yours, I can't stop thinking about you. You are in my heart, and in my thoughts. I love you beyond time, I love you beyond life. You, my love, are the most delicious addiction of my life. My life changed when I met you, it was the best day of my life, when I saw you for the first time. You are a great example and inspiration to me. You sing, with a strong, natural, true and intense voice. And so you, broke several barriers of time. His strong voice marks several generations. When we listen to his music feeling his essence, we don't let his history, memory and legacy, die. It will be as eternal as time. Every time we listen to your music, we connect to your heart. Our hearts are connected, beating in one rhythm, to the sound of your beautiful songs. His music, his memories and his legacy unite fans around the world. A being just spreads love around the world. We were lucky to have this great being living among us. He has a beautiful gift for music and dancing. Be heart, pure and generous. It just did good. It was a privilege for those who knew him personally, for those who saw him since he was little until the day he left this world. Unfortunately I met him, even after his departure, but to me, when I first saw him, it feels like I knew him, a long time ago, from other lifetimes. I thank you every day that this amazing and wonderful being lived among us, unfortunately for a short time, but enough to change my life and the lives of billions of people around the world. He will always be an example, a being with a pure heart did not see evil in people. That's why I love you so much, my beautiful angel. Thank you so much Michael J. for everything you've done in this world and continue to do through your legacy. But his image still bothers a lot of people, the great ignorant, after all, a great genius always bothered a lot. Envious people are bothered by who he is, and they are bothered by the presence he still has in this world and his presence will always be eternal in this world. Your infinite legacy. People, envying him, let their hearts be poisoned, by lies told about him, they do not open their hearts to the truth of the facts. Even though they know he is innocent, they still believe the lies, just to not assume that they were wrong and were condemning an innocent, only those who are jealous of him, for everything he is and represents for this world. What a pity that many did not appreciate everything he is. Today we cry, your absence from this world. Today we give importance to your attitudes. Missing him is an immense pain, not even time can heal. You will live in my heart and in my thoughts forever. His reign will always be eternal. üëëüëëüëëüéº üéµüé∂. I love you more than anything. Loving you is the best thing I've done in my life. I love you a thousand, millions, billions, trillions of times, this love is infinite. I love you, my eternal boy. * ‚ù£Ô∏èüíûüíóüíñ.

A part the fact that he was very rich, I don't think that was what was is problem.  He gave a load of money for charity.  And for animals.  So a guy, talent,  money etc.  And has a skin disorder. Then operations which are obvious.  He didn't really care.  Then the accusations.  All debunked, not because of his fortune , just that they were false.  A comeback , he seemed okay,  but needed to sleep,  a deep sleep.  He was dying and his doctor was on the phone with his mistress.  A legend died.  And he had a lot of songs to give.

Today, its quite opposite, but I see these videos as a source of happiness and ever lasting hardwork that MJ and others right there had put which is why even after so many  years of him passing its kinda fresh and evergreen.
Lots of love and respect to you.
