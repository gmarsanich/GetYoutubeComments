"As a Kiwi, I hope Felix knows that not a single one of us believe he has anything to do with the tragedy that was the Christchurch Mosque shooting. Absolutely none of us. Even our Prime Minister came forward and made it very clear that none of the blame falls on Felix. The victims have come forward and said the same. I truly truly hope he doesn't blame himself for this.",0.871,Positive,0.0914285714285714,Positive,-0.4759444296360016,Negative
