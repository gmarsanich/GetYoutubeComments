I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up (Oh, yeah)

I'm pickin' it up (Yeah), pickin' it up (Yeah)
Lovin', I'm livin', so we turnin' up
Yeah, we turnin' it up

Ain't got no tears in my body
I ran out, but boy, I like it, I like it, I like it
Don't matter how, what, where, who tries it
We out here vibin', we vibin', we vibin'

Comin' out, even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now, can't stop so shut your mouth
Shut your mouth, and if you don't know
Then now you know it, babe
Know it, babe, yeah

Right now, I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in like all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up (Oh, yeah)
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up

Oh, I just want you to come with me
We on another mentality
Ain't got no tears left to cry (To cry)
So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up (Oh, yeah)
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up

Pickin' it up (Yeah), pickin' it up (Yeah)
Lovin', I'm livin', so we turnin' up (We turnin' it up)
Yeah, we turnin' it up

They point out the colours in you, I see 'em too
And, boy, I like 'em, I like 'em, I like 'em
We're way too fly to partake in all this hate
We out here vibin', we vibin', we vibin'

Comin' out, even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now, can't stop, so shut your mouth
Shut your mouth, and if you don't know
Then now you know it, babe
Know it, babe, yeah

Right now, I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in like all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up (Oh, yeah)
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up

Oh, I just want you to come with me
We on another mentality
Ain't got no tears left to cry (To cry)
So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up (Oh, yeah)
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up

Comin' out, even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now (Hmm, oh)
Shut your mouth
Ain't got no tears left to cry
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Oh, I just want you to come with me
We on another mentality
Ain't got no tears left to cry (Cry)
So I'm pickin' it up (Yeah), pickin' it up (Oh yeah)

"Ya 4 años de No Tears Left Cry, la canción que trajo de regreso a la vida a Ari y a muchos de la Ariana Army.
Amo esta canción y tambien fue la primera canción que ame de ella, ya que se siente como un nuevo comienzo para la vida.
Aqui se siente a una Ari mas tranquila, mas madura, disfrutando de la vida, recuperandose de todo por lo que paso y lo demustra en sus letras, en su forma de interpretar y en como esta tomando la vida apartir de ahora.
Esta canción demuestra un antes y un despues en su carrera de Ari.
Me atreveria a decir que puedo escuchar esta canción y no aburrirme nunca y pues no necesito de volver haber pasado por un momento dificil para volver a escucharla, la escucharia porque simplemente me encanta y pues significa mucho para mi.
Feliz 4to Aniversario a No Tears Left To Cry, gracias por regresarme a la vida.
I love u, Ari, saludos desde Perú.",0.9862,Positive,0.220334928229665,Positive,0.8170067071914673,Positive

"※%%&$#%#Because the world becomes the Great Depression and maintains economy when I print a self currency and sprinkle it, such a trickery cannot continue. Therefore the Freemason causes war and resets it.

The Freemason rules the world, and this organization is writing a scenario to most war.

In Japan, it was blockaded the economy by encircling ABCD, and oil was embargoed. This means death for a modern nation. Electricity stops, and a production line stops and cannot prevent the aggression of other countries when a weapon equipped with an engine is not usable. Therefore I make the first move for self-defense, and Pearl Harbor is to have attacked it. The United States won against war and I made demonstration of the power of the atom bomb in the Soviet Union and did a hero side and controlled the world after the war. And I got colony, Japan of the best money tree. The United States hit the commission of the slave who made money in an article made in Japan produced in high technology and was able to become the King who could enjoy luxury. The Okinawa return of the United States still controls Japan effectively with the thing only for forms and will have the colony. The reason why the eirei that scuttled itself fought till the last is that I prevent the colonial rule. I believed that Japan revived as far as the Japanese spirit continued and closed my eyes forever.

The founding of a country of the United States slaughters the native candy reperception and begins by having plundered the territory. Europe and America of the principle of cruel supremacy of white invaded Asia and had the colony. Roosevelt, Churchill with a sense of crisis, the Stalin and others stopped at Japan which won against Russo-Japanese War against it gaining power and gathered and provoked Japan and drained PROBAGANDA which trained Japan to be an invader and were going to let Japan ruin. A wirepuller of Chiang Kai-shek was these free Mason and let you carry out an anti-Japan activity and repeated Japanese slaughter of Tyushu case The retaliation becomes the Shanghai incidents. Japan built the Manchurian country and was going to build the utopia by the rule of virtue. Japan makes a Mongoloid Korean of the same kind a sex slave and cannot slaughter the Chinese very much in Nanjing. I will pass not only Europe and America but also Asia to the enemy if I do something like that and Japan stands alone and ruins myself. I cannot perform such a suicidal act.

The United States was approximately 10 times in Japan when they compared the strength of a nation of the United States with Japan at the time of the Greater East Asia War (the strength of a nation of the United States comes from a colony and profit of the black ivory). In other words, it is the quarrel of a child and adult. Why does it invade it? Even if Japan was found to lose, I believed that it was a fight of the justice and fought. When it did Pearl Harbor attack, only sank a superannuation warship; misfired. You set the second attack, and why did you not blow up an airport base, a naval shipyard, an oil tank? You occupied Hawaii, and did you not do an aircraft carrier confrontation? In brief, this Pearl Harbor attack angered the American nation, and the fighting spirit was a stratagem to let you become exalted. Emperor Showa, cabinet minister, all the navy government bodies were Mason.

American Mason performs a plot a lot. There is the self-writing, self-Playing false flag strategy. There are the fight of the Alamo fort, a main issue case, Mayflower case, Gulf of Tonkin case, Pearl Harbor attack (I order a Japanese agent), 9,11 terrorist incident, Paris terrorist incident, J F Kennedy assassination case, Diana assassination case, a plane shooting down case (I order Ukraine) in Malaysia.

The equality was the concept that Mason thought about, and a phase contradicted freedom each other. If a company raises profit freely, there is it, and a rich person and poorman do not become equal. Freedom is restricted if I have the frames saying that I do it equally. Freedom and the equality are Operation double eagle of Mason. Of the quarrel that is fixed all the same not antagonism with the thing which Mason produced in both the liberalism nation and the communist state only play it. As for being hidden in the depths as for the commander-in-chief (Israel) of the evil in Revelation of Sun and Moon GOD. The world is instructed with structure braking under the pretense of two generals (Russia) quarrelling with one general (the United States) very much. In other words, Russia is together with the United States and rigs. Roosevelt ordered three Soviet Union from Stalin by a secret agreement of Yalta. The United States let money pay to Japan and, at the time of the Soviet Union collapse, saved the Soviet Union. Where is antagonism?

The Democratic Party copulates, too, and the LDP only rigs in the same way, too. Therefore I am under the patronage of Mason even if whichever wins. The American Republican and Democratic parties is the same, too. In other words, cards are marionettes of Mason. North Korea and the United States only perform a fixed quarrel when I understand this thing, and it is revealed that the United States lets you shoot a missile for Japan.

Cards and Putin advocate anti-Judea, but it is a downright lie. The Nazis advocated anti-Judea, too, but Germany of the defeated nation of World War I was made to assume a burden of the indemnification payment, and why did you manage to raise those war expenditures? I received support of the Judah iron. The Nazis had techniques such as a rocket, atom bomb development, the UFO production. Nazi cannot lose. In other words, I lost on purpose.

I let you accept the Plaza Accord and guide it to the strong yen that the United States makes Japan a bubble burst as for the Japan Airlines airplane 123 flights accident and snatches Japanese financial power of a nation by financial products (dice game gambling to say that the stock prices of Japan fall) and a share price manipulation and a fraud to say and am a threat case to lead it to the stock prices sudden fall. Salomon Brothers which sold a stock at a profit before a sudden fall obtained a vast profit. A pilot at U.S. forces shot it down and burnt the person whom a Korean military unit survived to death by a flame thrower. I shot a member of Self-Defense Forces with the sense of justice that was going to help it dead. As for the conduct like this devil being possible, there is only Mason. Therefore Boeing accepted the repair error of the false charge. Boeing refuses the act of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces decidedly.

Near future to read from Revelation Sun and Moon GOD and illuminaty card, and to untie it in Japan

It is the last war with original God and the evil god. Japan is the country which original God protects in a land of the gods, and the evil god (Freemason) holds the Japanese people hostage and is made to have an experience cruel most because it is the stomach which is going to conquer original God.

Final note
The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other I kill a cow pig, and to eat meat? I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. The human being takes the life of the lovely animal unconcernedly. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. A fornication is an act of the beast profaning God. A thing of the world is a thing of God, and the devil is the thief who stole the world from God and is a fraud deceiving the people. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. It is the devil that it behaves like God in original God that the devil can see in the present world. Therefore a disaster, an epidemic, the war damage giving an evil to the people are the wrath of Heaven. Why was much human life robbed of it by the Great East Japan Earthquake? As for it, a human evil deed was judged Ogami. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. I lead the world to the World War 3 that Freemason finally acts as order of the evil. I let a vindictive spirit does satanophany in the Freemason, and war cause. The World War 3 is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light. Are all of you ready????>>>?.....",-0.9996,Negative,-0.0493173987941429,Negative,-0.4945915043354034,Negative
