"Your butt is mine
Gonna tell you right
Just show your face
In broad daylight
I'm telling you
On how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind
Don't shoot to kill

Come on, come on
Lay it on me all right

I'm giving you
On count of three
To show your stuff
Or let it be
I'm telling you
Just to watch your mouth
I know your game
What you're about

Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothin'
Just wait 'til I get through

"John 3:16
[16]For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

Luke 13:3
[3]I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.

John 14:6
[6]Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

Matthew 18:11 
For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.

John 8:12
[12]Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. 

Matthew 4:17
 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

Romans 10:9 
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

Romans 10:13
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. 

Luke 6:27-38
But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, 
6:28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you. 
6:29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also. 
6:30 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again. 
6:31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise. 
6:32 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them. 
6:33 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same. 
6:34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again. 
6:35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil. 
6:36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. 
6:37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: 
6:38 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.


Ephesians 2:8-9
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
Not of works, lest any man should boast.

2 Chronicles 7:14
If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.

Matthew 5:2-12
King James Version
2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,
3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.
10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.

Matthew 24:4-14 
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.
24:5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.
24:6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
24:7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
24:8 All these are the beginning of sorrows.
24:9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
24:10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
24:11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
24:12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.
24:13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.


Exodus 20
King James Version
20 And God spake all these words, saying,

2 I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.

5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;

6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.

7 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:

10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:

11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.

13 Thou shalt not kill.

14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.

15 Thou shalt not steal.

16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.

"🇧🇷💞🇺🇸.*Meu lindo Super, Mega Pop Star, imperador, princípe e rei mais lindo do mundo, você tudo isso muito mais. Seu taleto muito maior podemos imaginar. Esse mês é o mês do meu aniversário vou comemorar, assistido todos clips do nosso rei num único dia. Meu rei te amar é o melhor presente poderia ter no meu aniversário. E meu desejo aniversário ele tivesse vivo. Pelo menos meu coração, ele está mais vivo que nunca. Recentemente Prince falou em seu instagram, para os fãs de seu pai para ajudar o clipe de Thriller a atingir 1 bilhão de visualizações para comemorar este ano o aniversário de 40 anos do álbum Thriller. Prince, você não precisa pedir duas vezes. Seu pedido é uma ordem para mim. Tudo para o nosso rei, ele merece tudo que ele, fez neste mundo.  Além Thriller, tem os clips They Don't Care About Us, Beat It vários outros clips. Pena que ele não está aqui comemorando 40 anos de seu grande e inesquecível álbum, Thriller. Você pode contar com a minha ajuda e ajudar bilhões de fãs do nosso rei. Meu rei, seu sorriso lindo vale mais mil palavras. Meu coração já seu, não consigo para de pensar em você. Você está meu coração, e nos meus pensamentos, e esse lugar só seu!!! Te amo além tempo, te amo além da vida. Você meu amor, é o vicio mais gostoso da minha vida. Minha vida mudou quando eu, te conheci, foi melhor dia da minha vida, quando te vi pela primeira vez. Você para mim grande exemplo e inspiração. Você cantava voz forte, natural, verdadeira e intensa. E assim quebrando várias barreira do tempo. Sua voz forte, marca várias gerações. Quando escutamos sua música sentinto sua essência, não deixamos sua história, memória o seu legado morrer. Cada vez escutamos suas música nós conetamos seu coração. Os nossos corações estão conectados, bater em um só ritmo, ao som lindas canções. Suas canções, e sua lembraças e seu legado uni fãs todo mundo. Quando a gente ama alguém de verdade. Esse amor não é esquecido jamais. Um ser só espalhava amor pelo mundo. A sorte tivemos ao ter grande ser, vivendo entre nós. Ele tem dom lindo, para música e dança. Ser corança puro e generoso. Só fez o bem. Foi um privilégio para quem conheceu ele pessoalmente, para quem viu ele desde pequeno até dia sua partida desse mundo. Eu, infelimente conheci ele, mesmo só depois sua partida, mais para mim, quando eu vi ele primeira vez parece conheci ele, há muito tempo de outras vidas. Agradeço todos dia ser incrivel e maravilhoso ter vivido entre nós, infelizmente pouco tempo, mais suficiente mudar a minha vida e vidas bilhões pessoas ao redor mundo. Ele sempre vai ser exemplo, ser coração puro não via maldade nas pessoas. Por isso te amo tanto, meu anjo lindo. Muito obrigado Michael J. por tudo você fez nesse mundo e continua fazendo atravez seu legado. Mais a imagem dele, ainda  incomoda muitas pessoas, os grande ignorantes, afinal um grande gênio sempre incomodou muito. As pessoas invejosas incomodava com ele é, se incomodam a presença ele ainda tem nesse mundo e seu presença será sempre eterna nesse mundo. Seu legado infinito. As pessoas por inveja dele deixa seu coração ser envenenado, por mentiras faladas contra ele, deixa de abrir o coração pela verdade dos faltos. Mesmo sabendo ele é incente muito continuam acreditanto nas mentiras, só para não assumir que erram e estavam condenando um inocente, só quem tem inveja dele, por tudo ele é e representa para esse mundo. Que pena muitos não valorizado tudo ele é. Hoje choramos, sua falta  nesse mundo. hoje damos importâcia sua atitudes. Saudade dele um dor imença, nem tempo consegue cura. Você viverá meu coração e nos meus pensamentos para sempre. Seu reinado sempre será eterno. 👑👑🎼 🎵🎶. Eu te amo mais que tudo. Te amar é melhor coisa fiz na minha vida. Te amo mil, milhões, bilhões, trilhões de vezes, esse amor é infinito. Te amo, meu menino eterno*❣️💞💗

"🇧🇷💞🇺🇸.* My handsome Super, Mega Pop Star, most handsome emperor, prince and king in the world. His much greater talent we can imagine. This month is the month of my birthday I'm going to celebrate watching all clips of our king in one day. My king loving you is the best gift I could have on my birthday. And my birthday wish he had alive. At least my heart he, it's more alive than ever. Recently, Prince spoke on his Instagram, for his father's fans to help the Thriller clip reach 1 billion views to celebrate the 40 years of the Thriller album. Will do this year. Prince, you don't have to ask twice. Your order is an order to me. Everything for our king, he deserves everything he's done in this world. In addition to Thriller, there are also clips They Don't Care About Us, Beat It and several other clips. Too bad he's not here celebrating 40 years of his great and unforgettable album, Thriller. You can count on my help and help billions of fans of our king. My king, your beautiful smile is worth a thousand words. My heart is already yours, I can't stop thinking about you. You are in my heart, and in my thoughts. I love you beyond time, I love you beyond life. You, my love, are the most delicious addiction of my life. My life changed when I met you, it was the best day of my life, when I saw you for the first time. You are a great example and inspiration to me. You sing, with a strong, natural, true and intense voice. And so you, broke several barriers of time. His strong voice marks several generations. When we listen to his music feeling his essence, we don't let his history, memory and legacy, die. It will be as eternal as time. Every time we listen to your music, we connect to your heart. Our hearts are connected, beating in one rhythm, to the sound of your beautiful songs. His music, his memories and his legacy unite fans around the world. A being just spreads love around the world. We were lucky to have this great being living among us. He has a beautiful gift for music and dancing. Be heart, pure and generous. It just did good. It was a privilege for those who knew him personally, for those who saw him since he was little until the day he left this world. Unfortunately I met him, even after his departure, but to me, when I first saw him, it feels like I knew him, a long time ago, from other lifetimes. I thank you every day that this amazing and wonderful being lived among us, unfortunately for a short time, but enough to change my life and the lives of billions of people around the world. He will always be an example, a being with a pure heart did not see evil in people. That's why I love you so much, my beautiful angel. Thank you so much Michael J. for everything you've done in this world and continue to do through your legacy. But his image still bothers a lot of people, the great ignorant, after all, a great genius always bothered a lot. Envious people are bothered by who he is, and they are bothered by the presence he still has in this world and his presence will always be eternal in this world. Your infinite legacy. People, envying him, let their hearts be poisoned, by lies told about him, they do not open their hearts to the truth of the facts. Even though they know he is innocent, they still believe the lies, just to not assume that they were wrong and were condemning an innocent, only those who are jealous of him, for everything he is and represents for this world. What a pity that many did not appreciate everything he is. Today we cry, your absence from this world. Today we give importance to your attitudes. Missing him is an immense pain, not even time can heal. You will live in my heart and in my thoughts forever. His reign will always be eternal. 👑👑👑🎼 🎵🎶. I love you more than anything. Loving you is the best thing I've done in my life. I love you a thousand, millions, billions, trillions of times, this love is infinite. I love you, my eternal boy. * ❣️💞💗💖.
