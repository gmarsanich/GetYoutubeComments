"A new disease in my town called Idiotic
Every pretty lady in my city got it, point blank

"Mother may I sleep with danger, please
It's been knocking on my door since I was seventeen
Oh, oh, and you saw but you choose to ignore
But now it's more than a wish, it's a dream
Now I don't understand how you can hold me back
You said ""Baby learn your lessons when you step on cracks""
Oh, there's no time to fall, existence would call
And see experimenting
And I guess there's just no other way
I've been drawn to a new escape, ay
'Cause I'm wearing bamboo and I'm picking up zoots
I've slipped away
Now I'm tonguing on a Rizla
And you sachi snows a deal for us
Oh, and dangers got me wrapped up 'round his thumb
But it's no trap 'Cause I'm in love
I said I'm in love
I said I'm in love
Yeah oh oh oh
I said I'm in love
I said I'm in love

Mother may I sleep with danger, please
It's been knocking on my door since I was seventeen
Oh, oh, and you saw but you choose to ignore
But now it's more than a wish, it's a dream
Now I don't understand how you can hold me back
You said baby learn your lessons when you step on cracks
So no, there's no time to fall how you go, oh
I get what I want, you see
'Cause I like to tread so carefully
And you won't, won't, won't, won't ever know

Tu y yo frente a Dios
Juramos tanto amor
Esto es mas que decepción y la prueba esta, el dolor
Por tanto tiempo lo dude

Quisiera que acabara ya pero dime que haré si te vas
Dime demente pues crees que no se lo que has hecho 
pero es tan evidente entre tu y yo hay alguien mas 
tan cerca pero lejos 
Entiendo todo ya
Eh perdido todo tu amor
Pero tu tienes mi corazón
Dime demente pues crees que no se lo que has hecho 
pero es tan evidente entre tu y yo hay alguien mas 
Eh dado todo de mi 
Tal ves no basta mi amor
descubriste miedo en mi ehh
Mintiendo, destrozando noo
Dime demente pues crees que no se lo que has hecho

"[Verse 1 - A$AP Rocky:]
A new disease in my town called Idiotic
Every pretty lady in my city got it, point blank
Periodically empty seats, dine at Ciprianis
Like Beyoncé, they're getting by or they get embodied
So Sasha Fierce, a whole lot of tears
Rolling down her cheeks, crying till she's sound asleep (sleep)
Preach (preach), pray (pray) that today is not a lonely one
You gotta know you not the only one

[Verse 2 - Sam Smith:]
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof is in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

[Chorus - Sam Smith:]
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 3 - Sam Smith:]
You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though God knows you have mine

[Chorus]

[Verse 4 - A$AP Rocky:]
We all guilty of the same crime if you ask me
I might've had a couple women at the same time
She can't handle the pressure, Jack Daniels for breakfast
A cap of valium mixed with antidepressants, precious
My momma said that we need love
Till I found out life's a bitch with no prenup, you're on your own
Divorces or court splits, decisions and choices
The Porsche or the fortress? Ignore it or forefeit

"Wiernym i uczciwym być
Przysięga brzmiała tak.
Jak długo chciałeś się z tym kryć?
Teraz ból dusi mnie, to trwa.

Wmawiałam sobie, to nie tak
Zbywałam każdą łzę
Bez ciebie żyć mam nie wiem jak
Chociaż żyć bez ciebie już chcę

Ja wiem i milczę
Rozchwiana jesteś, słyszę co dnia
Ja wiem, że mówisz kocham,
Lecz słyszę to nie tylko ja

Tak nieobecny stoisz tu
Przyczynę teraz znam
Nie dla mnie twego serca puls,
Chociaż ty miłość mą wciąż masz

Ja wiem i milczę
Rozchwiana jesteś, słyszę co dnia
Ja wiem, że mówisz kocham,
Lecz słyszę to nie tylko ja

Tyle lat byłam twoja, lecz
Bałam się, że przyjdzie ten czas
I ciałem stał się największy lęk
Rozdarłeś co łączyło nas

Ja wiem i milczę
Rozchwiana jesteś, słyszę co dnia
Ja wiem, że mówisz kocham,

"I always used to say to live lovely
You have love life and love lively honey
It’s kinda funny that after showers
You be sneaky over by him, after hours
And that devoured me when I heard that
That fact just towers me but I turned back
When I realized that I couldn’t do it alone
And I despise fucking choosing your home
Over my own 
But finances looking droughty
MacDonald’s paying me 5 dollars’ hourly
You might say it’s cowardly and money hungry
But trust me 
I need some dough, I’m putting it bluntly
But not to her though
She’s got me sold
With her pose, her strokes and her clothes
That closely fit her. Should I dispose
Of my feelings towards this
Bitch that I hate, admire, this queen of the fortress
But my hormones spinning, sinning, it’s quite torturous 
But Lord just 
Forgive me for what I done to my deportment 
I look messy now, I’m driving myself drunk
And I’m high as a kite, yet my heart has just sunk
And even after singing these songs, these words, these poems
My fucking women continues to blow him
Well she blows me too, but only off 
As often as she can, she aint wanna talk
She aint wanna fight, she aint wanna fuss
She aint wanna try, she aint wanna love
But that’s bull-shit, but name it however you wanna
Desperate, sex-driven, but I’ll never be forced to
Tell you anything, even my friends don’t know
Don’t even go out anymore. No sense, oh no!
I just sit at home, and think about you all day
I wanna kill yuh, but I’m stuck to you 
The fuck to you
When you saaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyy

"You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts

For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

[Chorus:]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

[Chorus:]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realize my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

[Chorus 2x:]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
