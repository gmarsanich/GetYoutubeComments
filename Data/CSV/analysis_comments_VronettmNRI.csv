so many ppl slept on this album fr ! she’s happy and i’m so so proud of her for coming so far from all of the pain she’s been through and where she used to be mentally in the swt/tun tour. yes she’s a lot more inactive but she’s married and she has priorities :) so beyond proud and happy for her. also the layering of her vocals in this album is insane ! deserves so much more recognition 🫂🤍,0.9466,Positive,0.38125,Positive,0.8027753233909607,Positive

"This girl is untouchable. She is the vocal standard by which our generation and surely several to come will reference just as the greats that paved the way, such as Whitney, Mariah, and deff Celine, just to name a few. Her effortless agility and range that just melts from one octive to another. Seamless transitions between chest and head voice. Incredible detachment to show such versatility and clarity in her whistle register. And this girl is a producer. When in studio, the producers listen to her, and follow her lead. That's rare.",0.6808,Positive,0.1375,Neutral,0.4340259432792663,Positive

"Will I ever love the same way again? (Way again)
Will I ever love somebody like the way I did you?
Never thought you'd be so damn hard to replace
I swear I don't mean to be this way
If I can't have you, is love completely off the table?
Do I sit this one out and wait for the next life? (Next life)
Am I too cold? Am I not nice?
Might not be quite yet healed or ready
Should I be goin' too steady? (Too steady)
But I just wanna know is love complеtely off the table?
Will you bе there? (Will you be there?)
Can I still love you? (Can I, can I, babe?)
Not yet healed or ready (not ready)
Shouldn't be goin' too steady (too steady)
Just wanna know is love completely off the table?
I'll wait for you
Even though it always feels like I'll be number two
To someone you can't hold anymore
If you let me in, I'm ready to give you what I couldn't before
'Cause I got you, girl, let me help you through it
You're trying to fill the void with a couple boys
I can see right through it (you can see right through it)
I can you love you harder than I did before
Was in a dark place back then
I was toxic, then I was toxic to someone else
I was haunted by the hills (oh yeah, yeah)
I couldn't give you my all, but I will
If you let me in your arms (your arms)
If you let me in your heart
I don't think that love's completely off the table
Will you be there? (Yes, I will be there for you)
Can I still love you? (Yes, I been hurt before, before)
Not yet healed or ready (not ready)
Shouldn't be goin' too steady (too steady, no, no)
Just wanna know is love completely off the table?
So can you hold me?
If I let you, can you prove it to me? (Oh, no-no, no)
'Cause I need you to calm me down, babe
Gotta get out of my head (oh, woah)
Tryna be healed from this pain (oh)
Just wanna know, just wanna know, can you, baby? (Hey)
Can you touch it like you believe in it, baby? (Oh, hey)
Do you think you never gonna leave on me, baby?
'Cause I ain't her and you ain't him, thankfully (baby, don't leave)
But it's gon' be hard to let someone else in again (woah)
Baby, baby (woo-hoo)
Will you be there? (Will you be there? I'll still wait)
(I'll still wait for you baby)
Can I still love you?
Not yet healed or ready (ooh, not ready)
Shouldn't be goin' too steady (no, no, ooh)
Just wanna know is love completely off the table, baby?

"Ariana is a good singer and has a beautiful voice, no one is denying that. But everyone in the comments acting like this performance is completely live which technically it can be considered to be live but people believing that that's exactly how she sounds is annoying. It clearly states in the credits that there was post audio editing done. And one can clearly hear that her vocals were pitch corrected. Which is fine and something I am not against being a singer myself. But I hate when people act ignorant and believe that these performances aren't pitch corrected, saying stuff like she doesn't need autotune, autotune needs her.

"ou know you really something, yeah
How'd we get here so damn fast?
Only you can tell me that
Baby, 'cause you know I'm coming back
You're making me forget my past
Never thought I'd feel like that again
I came to peace with my path
Now you got me off track
I've never been this scared before
Feelings I just can't ignore
Don't know if I should fight or fly
But I don't mind
Mmm
Tripping, falling with no safety net
Boy, it must be something that you said
Is it real this time or is it in my head?
Got me tripping, falling with no safety net
Let your guard down, girl
You know we came too far now girl (oh)
It's time for you to play your part now
You know we hit that jewelry store and we gon' ball out (yeah)
Ups and downs, we had some fallouts (ooh, yeah)
Put some ice on you, girl, let it thaw out (oh)
Girl, you're mine, it's safe to say
At the end of the day
I've never been this scared before
Feelings I just can't ignore
Don't know if I should fight or fly
But I don't mind (I don't mind, I don't mind)
Mmm (shee, woo)
Tripping, falling with no safety net (yeah)
Boy, it must be something that you said (said, yeah)
Is it real this time or is it in my head?
(In my head, oh, in my head)
Got me tripping, falling, with no safety net
Mmm, yeah
Every time you feel some way, feel a way
Never let me run away, run away, my baby
Every time you feel some way, feel a way
Never let (never let) me run away, run away (run away)
Girl, you got me tripping, falling with no safety net
Oh, whoa (baby)
Boy, it must be something that you said (something that you said)

Got me tripping, falling, with no safety net (with no safety net)
