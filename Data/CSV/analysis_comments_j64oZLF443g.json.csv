"I don't know why but I have a vivid memory of markiplier making (or at least starring in)  a game where you are on a ship and you can explore around free roam style.. you're supposed to stick around and watch cut scenes and help out the crew to stop various problems with the ship as well as try to save the ship from going into a sun. However if you backtrack at some points or avoid listening to all the cutscenes, things happen where mark can try to follow you and get you back on the mission.

I mean they're all just so creative, captivating, awe inspiring (just like space) and amazing and there's so many different ways it could go I respect the amount of time and effort and just everything that Mark puts into his videos and the series and it's amazing and Mark will continue to be my favorite YouTuber for that fact.
