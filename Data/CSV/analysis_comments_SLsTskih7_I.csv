"Jesus Christ Saves

Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.

Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.

EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:

1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.

2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.

Biblical References:
1. Romans 5:9
2. Romans 3:23
3. Romans 6:23
4. Romans 10:9
5. Romans 10:13
6. Ephesians 2: 8 & 9
7. John 3:16

Watch out, watch out, watch out, yeah
That's my shot, that's my shot, that's my shot, yeah
Spendin', I'm spendin' all my fuckin' pay
Ooh, Stoney
Cigarettes and a headband
Commas, commas in my head, man
Slumped over like a dead man
Red and black, 'bout my bread, man
I'm the answer, never question
Lace up, learn a lesson
Bitch, I'm saucin', I do this often, don't do no talkin'
My options right when I walk in, jump all them Jordans
I'm ballin', money jumpin'
Like I'm Davis from New Orleans
Or bitch I'm Harden, I don't miss nothin'
Fuck practice, this shit just happens, know y'all can't stand it
I have it, I never pass it, I work my magic
High average, ball on these bastards, it makes me happy
It's tragic, I make it happen, and all y'all Shaqtin'
White Iverson
When I started ballin' I was young
You gon' think about me when I'm gone
I need that money like the ring I never won, I won
Saucin', saucin', I'm saucin' on you
I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', oh-ooh
I'm ballin', I'm ballin', Iverson on you
Watch out, watch out, watch out, yeah
That's my shot, that's my shot, that's my shot, yeah

"A beginning is a very delicate time. Know then, that it is the year 10191. The known universe is ruled by the Padisha Emperor Shaddam IV, my father. In this time, the most precious substance in the Universe is the spice melange. The spice extends life. The spice expands consciousness. The spice is vital to space travel. The Spacing Guild and its navigators, who the spice has mutated over four-thousand years, use the orange spice gas, which gives them the ability to fold space. That is, travel to any part of the Universe without moving. Oh yes, I forgot to tell you, this song still hits different.
