"I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

As I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street
With not enough to eat
Who am I, to be blind pretending not to see their needs?

A summer's disregard
A broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could've been any clearer
If they wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed out dream (washed out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (oh)
I'm asking him to change his ways (oh)

I'm asking him to change his ways (better change)

you can't
(Then you close your) close your, your mind
With the man in the mirror, oh yeah
I'm asking him to change his ways (better change)
No message could've been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

gonna feel real good now

I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good
Come on (change)
Just lift yourself
You know
You've got to stop it
Yourself (yeah)

I've got to make that change today
(Man in the mirror) you got to
You got to not let yourself brother
(Yeah) you know
(Make that change) I've got to get that man, that man

You've got to
You've got to move
Come on
Come on
You got to
Stand up, stand up (yeah, make that change)
Stand up

"MJ..... Tu étais vraiment DIVINEMENT inspiré.... Un véritable ""Messager"".... Ce que beaucoup ne savent pas sur ta personne (entre autres) c'est que tu parlais TRÈS BIEN le Français. À cause de ton admiration pour la ville de Paris..... Tu avais suivi des cours particuliers de la langue française pendant 1 an..... Quelques rares personnes peuvent le confirmer notamment Lisa Marie et ta sœur bien-aimée Janet. Hélas, Janet vient de nous quitter à Miami tragiquement et subitement. Elle s'est renversée et s'est noyée en pleine séance de Ski Nautique pourtant une experte de la discipline..... Qu'elle ne repose pas en paix cette TRAÎTRESSE qui a conspiré contre toi pour t'afflaiblir mentalement et te mener à la mort physique..... Très proche de toi, elle avait pour mission de remplacer les anti-dépresseurs que ta Psychologue, Dr. AMani Franklin Delano, te prescrivait pour ton équilibre mental, par des anti-psychotiques..... Pourtant, tu n'étais pas fou..... Ainsi, ton état de santé mentale s'est dégradé au fil des temps ce qui t'a conduit progressivement à ce malheureux ""blanchiment"" de la peau que tu regrettes profondément puisque tu t'es toujours senti NOIR et  AFRICAIN dans le coeur..... Que dire de la cabale médiatique et juridique contre toi pour des fausses accusations de pédophilie, de viol etc..... Toi qui ADORAIT les enfants et rêvait d'un Monde Meilleur pour. eux.elles. Merciiiii MJ..... 4Ever..... Continue to stay by my side Legend. Together, We will take revenge and make America Great Again.

"He wrote this from the heart. I do not believe he was the monster so many accused him of being. His heart was full of compassion for everyone, especially children. He'd have to had a split personality to do such evil, and I don't believe it. Our news media loves to crucify everybody, and so willingly to believe lies over truth. For years, he shared his beliefs, his compassion in words, and in deeds. He has given millions to children's charities; I still remember the burn center for children he paid for, and so many others.

[16]For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

Luke 13:3
[3]I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.

John 14:6
[6]Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

Matthew 18:11 
For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.

John 8:12
[12]Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. 

Matthew 4:17
 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

Romans 10:9 
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

Romans 10:13
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. 

Luke 6:27-38
But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, 
6:28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you. 
6:29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also. 
6:30 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again. 
6:31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise. 
6:32 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them. 
6:33 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same. 
6:34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again. 
6:35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil. 
6:36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. 
6:37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: 
6:38 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.


Ephesians 2:8-9
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
Not of works, lest any man should boast.

2 Chronicles 7:14
If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.

Matthew 5:2-12
King James Version
2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,
3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.
10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.

Matthew 24:4-14 
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.
24:5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.
24:6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
24:7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
24:8 All these are the beginning of sorrows.
24:9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
24:10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
24:11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
24:12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.
24:13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.


Exodus 20
King James Version
20 And God spake all these words, saying,

2 I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.

5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;

6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.

7 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:

10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:

11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.

13 Thou shalt not kill.

14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.

15 Thou shalt not steal.

16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.

"I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street
With not enough to eat
Who am I, to be blind pretending not to see their needs?
A summer's disregard
A broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could've been any clearer
If they wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed out dream (washed out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (oh)
I'm asking him to change his ways (oh)
And no message could've been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (oh)
I'm asking him to change his ways (oh)

I'm asking him to change his ways (better change)
No message could've been any clearer
(If you wanna make the world a better place)
(Take a look at yourself and then make the change)
you can't
(Then you close your) close your, your mind
With the man in the mirror, oh yeah
I'm asking him to change his ways (better change)
No message could've been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
gonna feel real good now
I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good
Come on (change)
Just lift yourself
You know
You've got to stop it
Yourself (yeah)
I've got to make that change today
(Man in the mirror) you got to
You got to not let yourself brother
(Yeah) you know
(Make that change) I've got to get that man, that man
You've got to
You've got to move
Come on
Come on
You got to
Stand up, stand up (yeah, make that change)
Stand up

"This man was something else. He was and is still the greatest performer of all time. He always was and always will be. And for anyone who doesn't see that, and disrespects this man, someone needs to slap the hell out of you. The amount that he did for this world cannot be matched by any other human being. The reason there are so many coloured artists in the music industry, the reason the music industry is so diverse, is because of this man. He united everyone and made a change in the world. He was a superhuman. After you've seen how people react at his concerts, come and bring me another solo artist that has made people react like that. I'll wait for the day when someone can do that. The heart that MJ had was simply incredible. He cared for everyone. And the media destroyed him. Why? For money. That's all the accusations were about. And for people that don't understand that, then you don't know about Michael, so keep your mouth closed. You don't have a right to speak negatively of this man. Every single modern day artist has used small things from MJ in their own performances. Everything links back to MJ. He changed the world. He basically wasn't human. He was and is a hero that has been sent down from a place that isn't earth, because the world today, is not what it was when he was here. Everyone can say what they want, I don't care. This man ruled the world and still does. The greatest, biggest legend of all time. The king of everything, Michael Jackson.

We can't change ALL by ourselves, everytime we try to change, we always go back to doing the wrong thing again. 

It's ONLY JESUS that can change us, which will then cause US to change the world the way God originally created it to be. 

Peace, love & goodness can ONLY be found in JESUS CHRIST. 

Religion & man-made government can't change the world, ONLY JESUS CAN. But it's up to you to accept it.",0.8294,Positive,0.046875,Positive,0.4324252009391784,Positive

"Hey remember when democrats were willing to change themselves for the better of all, instead of the nazi communist wannabes that are obsessed with forcing others to change based on what they think is right? Its offensive how they target our children's education, are constantly lying and don't even have the basic IQ to formulate an argument instead they turn to threats and violence, and the celebrities who think they know better than everyone else, the elites like big tech, big pharma, big tobbaco, big whatever that are constantly milking everyone for money and the government is willingly blind because they have stock shares that they are growing, and finally putting the most incompetent, destructive, pure evil leaders in power. The world changed alot in the last decades.",-0.9685,Negative,-0.035,Negative,-0.3263450562953949,Negative

As a homeless girl I definitely want to keep my head held high. I’m in a homeless shelter and I want to work and work to get on my feet again. I can’t let fear get the best of me anymore. When I look in the mirror I tell myself to be strong and ball my hand into a fist knowing I won’t give up. Somebody has to be that FIST!!! Never give up! ✊✊✊✊✊✊ #change #hope #fist #nevergiveup,0.942,Positive,0.54,Positive,0.4508874118328094,Positive
