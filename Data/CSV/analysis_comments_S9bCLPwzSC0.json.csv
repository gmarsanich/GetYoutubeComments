"It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of them were from me
'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas
I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause daddy felt like a bum
See daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom

"Listening to this album after turning 30, I was just 13 when I fell in love with it. I was a huge Eminem fan as a teenager and I remember taking particular notice of how different this song was and how sweet it was that he sang for his daughters. I think this is my first time watching the video and I'm hit with a new wave of emotions. I love how much he humanized him and Kim here. Seeing those home videos kinda made me understand why they kept going back to each other despite all the abuse...they were a normal family.",0.9432,Positive,0.21066919191919195,Netural,0.38007065653800964,Positive

"Oh wow AS Puerto Rican and songwriter myself I heard this years ago but I wasn't a Father back then I couldn't relate to the punchlines but OMG call me a baby but this got me crying,The government took our kids on some fabricated allegations we fought hard and got em back 2 years pass they took them again because mommy had a pill miscount in her prescription of Clonazepam we fought even harder and to this day they are still with us but the case is still open when they took my twins they were 4 months old and today they are 6 years! now you do the math a case should not be open that long specially when Parents are putting in the work,a lot of it was race things,the foster people threw my baby one of the twins in a pool and watched until he stopped struggling,then he took him out,my baby was dead but Glory be to Almighty God that he sent him back! I was on my knees crying to God and trying to get Him to take me Instead of my baby and I cried I ran out of tears I lost their first and second birthday,first and second Christmas and several other things that only happen once in a lifetime for every kid because they don't stop growing I have 5 kids and I'm 31 years old 3 biological and 2 are step son and step daughter but like I say they're all mine! Won't keep writing more on this comment but If you want to know more hit me up! because this don't ends here this is only the tip of the Iceberg...May God Almighty,The Lord of Hosts and Father of the King that He Raised for us Jesus Christ bless everyone that take the time to actually read all of this!

"I love this song, I'm young, i can't say I've always loved it, but when i discovered it, i felt touched on a personal level, it makes me crying seeing how dedicated Marshall is and was to parenting hailee better than his own parents did, i was abused too, i still am, though my mother is still misunderstood and has anger issues i don't think she should take her GAD as an excuse to abuse and hit me, and i love Eminem for his fatherly self, i wished that my father was like Eminem, yet i can only dream.

Its truly inspiring to see how far Marshall has come, and i wish him best for the future as he seems all better now, and i promise that i will treat my kids how Eminem treated his own.

"I really wanna know Hailie’s reaction to this song. Does she ever listen to it? Like I’m not Eminem’s daughter but I can feel his love and care for his little girl and I really hope hailie appreciated this song and holds it close to her heart. 
Idk, this song is soo deep. It’s like a personal letter but in a beautiful song form. The only song that makes me cry everytime I listen to it. It’s a father, feeling like a failure yet staying strong and having hope, for his little girl. Telling her that things are rough, but he’s always there for her. The story of this song, it’s so personal and deep. You can tell Eminem was feeling every emotion and word while he wrote and sang this song. He was literally talking to his daughter through it.He loves his daughter beyond words, you can tell. This is so beautiful. 🥺❤️ this was when rap was the deepest most meaningful genre.

I love hearing him express love to his daughter but more so the recognition of what she went through and was put through and his role in it. He wanted the best but still couldn’t provide it. He admits it and doesn’t make her feel guilty for having her own feelings and trauma. He also doesn’t make himself a victim. This is one of the most manly and loving pieces of music to have been shared with the world. Will always be a favorite to me.

"I can definitely relate to Ems from his kids point of view. My parent were struggling ever since they got married and got me, debts and moving houses is a frequent thing my whole life. They were saving up alot to build me a home, a tuition, everything was literally their blood and tears. I had to move to my grandparents house because mom and dad were handling the debts in the city. They finally can afford for me living with them after 2 year of my dad fighting with depression, he couldnt go to work so mom have to carried him through all of it. The next few years they got a little better with financial problems, but things kept going up and down, they fought alot over it too. And after years and years of struggling, finally they bought a house, at that moment, i think life is way better than it used to be, but then mom got cancer. After two years of battling with cancer, she passed away and a few months right before mom's passing, dad went to jail because of some mixed up, so they never had a chance to see each other the last time, at the time, i was dealing with mental health problems so its hard for me to actually talk to mom and tell her goodbye, still my biggest regret ever. My parent were trying so hard just to make me smile and i have so much respect for them.

Rest in Peace, Momma, you and Dad deserve the world",-0.9698,Negative,0.027373015873015886,Netural,0.39103591442108154,Positive

"Yeah
I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me.

Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up as daddy, that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

(Ha)
It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broken into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurts so bad it broke your mamma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
And flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
And you and Lainnie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, I guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Lainnie I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, mama's only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya

"Where Is The Work Husband?

Where Is The Work Husband?

And are you sure that that is the right one?

Is that really Adam? And or the one who comes in after him?

Where the fxkx is Adam? 

How is someone else just doing his job then? 

If the janitor is working as the CEO then where is the other CEO?

And then who the fxxk is cleaning up the environment?

1:33 ""Rejoice in the truth and not the chaos"" -- tHB. ""If you wanna go fast go alone. If you wanna go far, go together"" -- African Proverb. ""Be Busy Like The Wise Ant"" -- tHB. Im starting with my truth. Its best when you didnt build it all yet. That little shark. That little lie grows with the village truths. As those grow too. BEDMAS. Youve got to divide before you multiply. Game of Thrones was just the family tea. Politics is just the inter working of friends working together. And or poeple coming together to hopefully fight for what is right// good for the community. gOD in the valley. Im not worried about the oe that I can see coming. ""Save Half For Harvest"" -- tHB. We Build then righteousness based on truth. Its a horrible place to be. But a great place to start. What is hidden peace will bring to you. 1984. Let it not be war. Truth towards solution is what peace can bring to you then too. If you build with righteousness based on truth. There's Hope. You judge me for feeding the emotionally homeless? The spiritually homeless? The spiritually homeless? There is a truth in the fake smile in a crowd that is frowning. ""Your vibe attracts your tribe"". And so if you have to balance it out in the letter that means that you can no longer keep up with the lie. That means that somewhere in the lie your living in an environement of truth. Im not twisting my brain to understand your lies. But the homeless are tired of lying. Most likely to tell the truth of what is really wrong within the homes, the family, that is the foundation of society. ""You wanna know about life, then go to your house in the mourning"" -- tHB. Talk with the ones who can no longer keep up with the lies. Sometimes you just have to say when for the ones who will do almost anything to keep going. The leaves die before winter. And if ""Autumn Refrain"" then who kills of the leaves throughout the harsh winters that they were never supposed to endure. Did anybody account for that when they stopped the fall. The scales need to balance first. So where do you put the leaves to rest during the winter. So that they are not running rabid when they just shouldnt be. Who is autumn VP? Where do you run to? And wher do you put your thoughts, efforts and interest into? That will tell me about you. And then how can you love in an emotional baseline? What about an emotional surplus? You did wrong prison. You did right outside of society. Libraries still need to be guarded. Especially when there is inner peace near. Who helps the ones stock up for hibernations? Who feed the leaves that dont like like they should during the winter season! The poeple need a break and so who is taking over when helping the ones when they should be resting? And or securing a space where they can rest. It still snows in the winter right? With and or without a boss. And so then who then harvest? There are two harvesters for every deck. And so then two CEO's. President and First Lady like Adam & Eve. Are work marriage. Not personal life Marriage. And so then where has Adam been working all this time? You stand on your truth. And so then where did // how did you let the people stand on there truth. Even if it is something somewhere new? Where did you give room for growht? Culture shock? New environment? Growing Pains? Fear? Fright? ""Did you maybe hide the sayings of the dark from the youth"" -- tHB. Cause you wanna tell them before the truth find them. And they fear even you. And they fxxk up any process that you may trying to make. When you want the people to fear you and then it works. And they fear you so bad they have confrontation with calculated promises expectations with no truth brought to you. How do you deal with truth? What happens if they fxxk up? Put people in a place that is good for them and then see who you are dealing with? See what you see. Did you account for the translation in language bearers and or cultures? Born A Crime by Trevor Noah. That man will build an arc. All the africans came together but they could talk but they didnt all understand each other. Equity before the equality. Even J Cole Let the money get to him before he understood that it wouldnt buy him happiness. ATM KOD. You give a homeless man a 100 and then you try and judge what he does with it. Come on he may not even know where his next meal is coming from. He may not even have a roof over his head. Did you teach the man to fish and or risk destabilizing the environment? Did you teach him the beauty of the environment first? The beauty of peace first. Its not everything. But did you make room for how guest can be treated apart from family? What about the proper way for how to treat strangers. If you dont like them then let them go. Why do have someoen that you dont like stay? So then did you try and understand the connective tissue then first. Did you try and understand why that person wasnt there yet. Matthew 7:5. Was that an in house problem? Did you start there; yet? James 2:20. ""Do Not Embrace Ignorance"" -- tHB. Problems at homeland you get mad at the guest. Did you even at least first acknowledge the problems within the house. Is it connected to the guest. Did you address it this way and then maybe send the guest on there way to address the family issue. Or did you just get made at the foreigner? What about the truth? Why are they there? Why havent you gotten rid of them yet? Start with there connection to you? Start with the connective tissue between the mutual friends. Between the common interest. Did you address Jonadab yet? And or the sibling that did the crime yet? And or are you just getting mad at Tamars friend. Pre and or Post Ashened. If you dont like speak truth. You can send them to a better environment. And deal with the problems within the home. Start with the truths that you can carry. ""Do not hide the sayings of the dark from the youth"" -- tHB. Why dont people warn the kids of the spirituality adn or the soulfulness?That your soul can pulled out of your body through sexual violation? Did no one want to warn tAMAR about that first?

"Yeah
I know sometimes things may not
Always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me
Hailie, I know you miss your mom
And I know you miss your dad when I'm gone
But I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad
Even when you smile
Even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes
Deep inside, you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared
I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying
Wipe them tears
Daddy's here
No more nightmares
We gonna pull together through it
We gon' do it
Lainie, uncle's crazy ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins
When it swirls
When it whirls
When it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Looking puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move
Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it
But somehow it seems, the harder that I try to do that
The more it backfires on me
All the things, growing up
As daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see
But you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way
Your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when was teenagers
But then of course
Everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something
We have no control over
And that's what destiny is
But no more worries
Rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up
And this will all just be a dream
Now hush little baby don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady
I told ya, daddy's here to hold ya

"Hey you, yes you who is watching this, I'm asking you, 
Ever wondered Why there's so much suffering in this world? And Why do we die?

Suffering is because of Sin, once sin is 🔪 suffering will also be 🔪
This is the proof of sin in each one of us, check yourself out:
Ever Lied?
Ever Disrespected Parents?
Ever Got angry on people?(anger=murder)
Ever Stolen?
Ever Lusted after someone?(lust=adultery)

Because Everyone has sinned against God and became worthy of death(☆Rom 6:23) but God being a Loving Father sent His only beloved Son for us on the Cross✝️ to be Sacrificed as a ransom for our sins(We committed crime,  Jesus paid fine ☆John 3:16).
