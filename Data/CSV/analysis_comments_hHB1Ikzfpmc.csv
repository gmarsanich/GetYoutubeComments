"I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready
Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall
And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us (huh)
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy

Everybody wants to be

My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
Uh, look
Okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
P-P-Posted, being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em hasta luego
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic
Quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking
Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
Batter, batter up, who the baddest?
It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy
Oh, the misery

"I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready
Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall
And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us (huh)
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
Uh, look
Okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
P-P-Posted, being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em hasta luego
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic
Quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking
Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
Batter, batter up, who the baddest?
It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Pray it away, I swear
I'll never be a saint, no way
My enemy
Pray it away, I swear
I'll never be a saint.",-0.9931,Negative,0.125,Neutral,-0.3629777133464813,Negative

"Romania
Mă trezesc la sunetele tăcerii care permite
Pentru ca mintea mea să alerge cu urechea până la pământ
Caut să văd poveștile care sunt spuse
Când mă întorc cu spatele la lumea care zâmbea când m-am întors
Să-ți spun că ești cel mai mare
Dar odată ce te întorci, ei ne urăsc
Oh, mizeria
Toată lumea vrea să fie dușmanul meu
Scutește-te de simpatie
Toată lumea vrea să fie dușmanul meu
(Ai grija de tine)
Inamicul meu (uite, uite, uite, uite)
(Ai grija de tine)
Dar sunt gata
Cuvintele tale pe perete în timp ce te rogi pentru căderea mea
Și râsetele pe holuri și numele pe care am fost chemat
Îl stivuiesc în minte și aștept timpul
Când îți arăt cum e să fii cuvinte scuipate într-un microfon
Să-ți spun că ești cel mai mare
Dar odată ce te întorci, ei ne urăsc (huh)
Oh, mizeria
Toată lumea vrea să fie dușmanul meu
Scutește-te de simpatie
Toată lumea vrea să fie
Inamicul meu (uite, uite, uite, uite)
(Ai grija de tine)
Inamicul meu (uite, uite, uite, uite)
(Ai grija de tine)
Uite
Bine, sper ca cineva să se roage pentru mine
Mă rog să spere cineva pentru mine
Stau acolo unde nimeni nu s-ar fi imaginat
P-P-Posted, fiind o epavă de emoții
Gata de plecare oricând, doar anunțați-mă
Drumul este lung, așa că pune pedala în podea
Inamicul pe urmele mele, energia mea indisponibilă
O să le spun până apoi
Vor să comploteze pe trap meu până în vârf
Am ieșit în formă, gândindu-mă că sunt astronaut
Am aruncat roca planetei pentru a provoca o catastrofă
Și contează mai mult pentru că nu l-am avut
Dacă m-aș fi gândit să fac ravagii într-o opoziție
Cam șocant că au vrut statică cu precizie, eu sunt automat
Quarterback, nu vorbesc despre concediere
Împachetează-l, împachetează-l, nu intru în panică
Aluat, aluat, cine este cel mai rău?
Nu contează pentru că suntem la gât
Toată lumea vrea să fie dușmanul meu
Scutește-te de simpatie
Toată lumea vrea să fie
Dușmanul meu
Oh, mizeria
Toată lumea vrea să fie dușmanul meu
Scutește-te de simpatie
Toată lumea vrea să fie dușmanul meu
Roagă-te, jur
Nu voi fi niciodată un sfânt, în niciun caz
Dușmanul meu
Roagă-te, jur
Nu voi fi niciodată un sfânt",-0.9843,Negative,-0.0042087542087542,Negative,-0.3149272799491882,Negative
