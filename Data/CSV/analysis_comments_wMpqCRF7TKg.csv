But the lyric ""You told your family for a reason: you couldn't keep it in"" hurts, knowing that he had to contact everyone and tell them it wasn't happening that night. I doubt he's still upset, seeing as we've been married for a year and a half, but I'm still kind of careful not to blast this track around him (like I do in my own car.)",-0.8645,Negative,0.1695833333333333,Neutral,0.4323466122150421,Positive
