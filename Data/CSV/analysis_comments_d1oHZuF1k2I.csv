"As a plus-size older woman. The key to shopping Shein is you have to know your exact sizes. Then you click on the ovals that are on top of every item. Because each item doesn't fit the same way. Although, they are the same sizes. Then you scroll down and read the reviews to see how they fit others of your size. They will tell you how the actual fit is. Sometimes you need to size up. I think if you would have known that before you ordered. You would have been happier with your selections. Plus, you get free returns for what you didn't like the fit. The clothes selections that you picked were your own personal style. And I love that. So if you decide to ever try them again. You now know the tips and tricks. Let me know if that helps. I shop  them all the time.",0.9256,Positive,0.2413194444444444,Positive,0.3228124380111694,Neutral
