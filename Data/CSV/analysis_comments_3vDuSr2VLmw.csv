"Ya know these guys are  vastly different from the original bad guys.  I mean for one they started out good because they wanted to do good, these guys didn't at first.  Example 2 Tarantula, in this version  Tarantula is a she who is called webs but in the original Tarantula Is a geeky guy called legs. Both are highly skilled hackers however so least they kept that. Another thing though,  Mr Tarantula didn't get a criminal file in the books, But Ms Tarantula does.  Example 3, Mr wolf. In this version Mr wolf starts out as a bad guy who along the way learns to be good,  but in the original series he starts out wanting to do good and does so by creating the Good Guys Club and unlike the movie wolf, we actually get to see Mr wolf's criminal file in the book series. Course there are similarities to the book with the movie, the criminal files on shark, pirahna are the exact same and Mr snakes as well, but this version has the ability to Crack any safe. Also I find it funny that both versions of shark are supposed master's of disguises. Like wow even at the beginning, book series shark was just a natural at it.
