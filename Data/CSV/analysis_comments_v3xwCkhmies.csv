Love of my life, you've hurt me

Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know

Love of my life, don't leave me
You've stolen my love, and now desert me
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know

"Hi, I'am Ariel, from MX, I am looking for an lender to give a boost to my project if someone is interested to help me I would appreciate a lot, I am dedicated to the design and manufacture of bags, suitcases, purses, hats, etc. I really need someone to believe in me and support my talent. I can pay the interest and sign a note and contract, my business is legally constituted.

Please, I really need help, I need to carry out my project, if you know someone who can make me a loan it would be of great help to me, I just want an opportunity, please <3",0.9904,Positive,0.4416666666666667,Positive,-0.2783491611480713,Negative
