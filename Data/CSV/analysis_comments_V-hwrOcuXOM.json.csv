"Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.¬† You

all who repent and turn to him by faith.¬† We are all guilty of sin.¬†
We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.¬† We are all Guilty before
a Holy and Righteous God.¬† GOD is not just all loving and overlook your
sin.¬† He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good.
The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly
Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.¬† We can‚Äôt
keep the Law we break most all commandments.¬† But Jesus fulfilled ALL by
his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not.
Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly. ¬†Turn, repent of your
sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.¬† Put your
faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.¬† Jesus was raised
from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace

I bought such a knife on AliExpress (it didn‚Äôt even say it is an automatic one ie illegal) and Police came knocking (4 of them with a doggo) because of my attempt to illegally import weapons into the country. I had to come in for questioning and it went to the DA‚Äôs office. They actually tried to prosecute me. Lucky I got a lawyer and was able to prove not knowing this was an automatic weapon (not knowingly imported). I live in Switzerland. I hope the law is more gentle on you Pewds ‚ù§Ô∏è,-0.4417,Negative,0.07441077441077441,Netural,-0.569871187210083,Negative
