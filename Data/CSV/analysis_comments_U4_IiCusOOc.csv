Also plastic surgery is such a trend at the minute. Young people in their late teens early 20s are wanting Botox and filler for extremely fine lines which could be fixed over time with hydration. It’s devastating especially now we are at a time where some people disclose how they’ve had work done but most don’t so younger people are taking it as if they haven’t disclosed it they must be all natural. Same as filters etc younger people aren’t bringing in photos of celebrities to their surgeon anymore they are bringing filtered versions of themselves. I could talk for hours about this subject and don’t even get me started on the body. I’m all for people having cosmetic surgery but there needs to be more education on the subject rather than just before and afters and maybe some info on the procedure…people are forgetting it’s a medical procedure that heavily ties in with mental well-being. It shouldn’t be treat like some taboo subject we can’t talk about but it also shouldn’t be something we can go get done on our lunch break in some place where you can also get eyelash extensions,0.8379,Positive,-0.0141666666666666,Negative,-0.3574176132678985,Negative

"I've always hated plastic surgery, but I could never lay my finger on why that is. And it's not just for the people who took it too far, it's also people who do just a nose job or just an eyelid surgery ( Although, when it is to fix some actual deformity/ a wound, I don't find it repulsive.)
But after watching this and thinking about it for a bit, I think I know why it is. I like nature. I like animals and plants and how everything is different and unique. I can find something with imperfect features to be perfectly flawed and beautiful. I would always prefer a real plant over a fake plant made of plastic. And to me, that's what you are if you did lots of plastic surgery. You disrespected nature. You spatt on all of your ancestors. You became perfect, and thus, destroyed all of your unique beauty.

That's how I feel. I'm glad I finally realized why that is. Thanks pewds :)",0.9666,Positive,0.1466666666666666,Positive,0.5470776557922363,Positive

"If I had the money to perform many surgeries on myself I would have used that money to get someone to help me with body dysmorphic disorder.

Changing yourself physically isn’t going to help you change mentally too. You can’t just hate how you look and change your imperfections and suddenly love yourself. It doesn’t work like that for me. If I can afford plastic surgery I would get a coach or someone to just guide my through training and hard work and I’ll get to my goal through that. I want to feel better, not just be better about myself. I think that it’s better to suffer through hardship and achieve something and feel actually good about yourself from it instead of doing nothing but spending money on yourself and you just don’t know when to stop because you don’t see that you’re already good the way you are.",0.7047,Positive,0.2391025641025641,Positive,-0.497341901063919,Negative

"People seeking multiple plastic surgery procedures should instead be referred to a psychologist to evaluate their mental and emotional fitness as well as uncover why they feel they need all these different surgeries.

But strongly believe that there should be a legal limit to the amount of plastic surgery that can be done to a human being and that anyone who wants to treat plastic surgery like a yearly check up needs a psych evaluation more than they need to modification.
