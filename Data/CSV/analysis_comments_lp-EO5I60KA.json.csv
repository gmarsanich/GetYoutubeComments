"(Lyrics)
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are, oh
So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are, oh
So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart

"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And, darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me—I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So, honey, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way (mmm...)
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

That, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are (oh, oh)

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lo-ud

So, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
But maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are

"When your legs don't work 
like they used to before

君の足が前と同じようには
動かなくなってしまって

And I can't sweep you off of your feet

そして僕が君をときめかせられなくなっても

Will your mouth still remember 
the taste of my love?

君の口はまだ僕の愛の味を覚えていてくれる？

Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

君の目はまだ頬から笑ってくれる？


And, darling,
I will be loving you 'til we're 70

愛しい人、僕は
僕らが70歳になっても君を愛してるよ

my heart could still fall as hard at 23

僕の心臓は23歳の時と同じように
君に強く恋してるだろう

And I'm thinking 'bout how

people fall in love in mysterious ways

人が恋に落ちる様子は不思議だなって

Maybe just the touch of a hand

多分ただ手が触れただけなのに

Well, me—
I fall in love with you every single day

そうだね、僕も毎日君に恋に落ちてる

And I just wanna tell you I am

それをただ君に伝えたいんだ


So, honey, now

だから、ねえ今

Take me into your loving arms

愛しい君の腕の中へ僕を導いて

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

千の星の光の下で僕にキスしてくれ

Place your head on my beating heart

鼓動する心臓の上に君の頭を重ねて

I'm thinking out loud

つい口に出た

Maybe we found love right where we are

多分今この場所で僕らは愛を見つけたんだね


When my hair's all but gone
and my memory fades

僕の髪も記憶も全て抜け落ちて

And the crowds don't remember my name

観客も僕の名前を覚えていなくて

When my hands don't play the strings 
the same way

僕の手が前と同じようには
ギターを弾けなくなってしまっても

I know you will still love me the same

君は変わらず僕を愛してくれるんだろう


'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old,
it's evergreen

だって君の魂は衰えることなく
若々しいままだろうから

And, baby,
your smile's forever in my mind and memory

君の笑顔は
僕の記憶と思い出の中で永遠に残り続けるよ

I'm thinking 'bout how

考えてるんだ


people fall in love in mysterious ways

人が恋に落ちる様子は不思議だなって

Maybe it's all part of a plan

多分それは全部計画のうち

Well, I'll just keep on making 
the same mistakes

うん、きっと僕はこれからも
同じ間違いを何度も繰り返すんだろう

Hoping that you'll understand

その度、君が理解してくれたらいいな


That, baby, now

だから、ねえ今

Take me into your loving arms

愛しい君の腕の中へ僕を導いて
