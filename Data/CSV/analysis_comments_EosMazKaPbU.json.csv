However one thing that I can definitely say is that he's one of the greats, even though he's currently not in his prime (still think his music is great though).",0.9552,Positive,0.23229166666666667,Netural,0.3972882628440857,Positive

(D.a. got that dope)
They say these bars are like COVID (bars are like COVID, what?)
You get 'em right off the bat (you get 'em right off the bat, yeah)
Infected with SARS and Corona (infected with SARS and Corona)
Like you took a bite off of that (you took a bite off of that, damn)
And it goes from martian to human (from martian to human, yeah)
That's how the virus attacks (that's how the virus attacks)
They come at me with machine guns (at me with machine guns, brr)
Like trying to fight off a gnat
Still stackin' my chips, hoes
Higher than Shaq on his tiptoes
Atop the Empire State Buildin'
This shit is like child's play, childrеn
I will anni-nihilate, kill them
I'll fuck around and pile еight million
Dead little juveniles, wait, chill, then
I'll await my trial date 'til then (what?)
Ain't nothin' you say could ever trump (nah), mic, pencil get killed (yeah)
If you're hypersensitive, I wasn't referencin' the vice president, chill (chill)
I mean my penmanship at times tends to get ill, violence but with skill
That's why I hence when I write ends up
With the mic and pencil gettin' killed (haha, yeah, hold up)
And I'm still ride or die for the squad (yeah)
So you know which side that I'm on
If a battle line's ever drawn, but if I get involved
It'll be like K9's in a brawl
But not similar to Mike Vick at all
'Cause even if I don't have a dog in the fight
They ain't never gonna get rid of the fight in the dog (fight in the dog)
Got stripes like a tiger, so you might get mauled, a mic in the palms
Like claws, I can swing right for your jaw
And rip it off with one swipe of the paw
Bitch, you still on my dick or nah? (Nah)
If I suck, your wife is a straw (straw)
I'm sick and I'm not gonna cover my mouth next time that I cough 'cause

They come at me with machine guns (at me with machine guns, brr)
Like trying to fight off a gnat
And d.a. got that dope he sends to me (uh-huh)
It's like pneumonia symptoms and contracting COVID instantly
Which is what separates my flow from theirs
So that no one gets even close to this to pose a risk to me
So vocalistically (what?), that's social distancing (yeah)
Flow going viral, you best stay strapped
With that Lysol and get way back (shh)
Get that Pine-Sol and that Ajax
'Cause this dry cough is just like football umpires callin' a playback
Bitch, back the fuck up like 15 yards
These rhymes call for a face mask (face mask)
'Nother 14-day quarantine, they're cordoning off everything
This shit lookin' like a horror scene, like me metaphorically (damn)
'Cause them stay-at-home orders seem
Like they just keep getting more extreme
Who knows when this night-Marilyn
Like Monroe, Norma Jean (Norma Jean)
Still got that heroin lyrical drip with that morphine and that Thorazine
'Cause I'm so fuckin' dope (dope) and you're a fiend
And that's the one thing that hasn't changed (nope)
For some semblance of normalcy
But I might need that Hydrochloroquine 'cause I got that (yeah)
The Dark Horse, I'm a knight-mare
Mom fed me Valium like air (mmm)
Thought that's why they called it a high chair (whoa)
I got a contact like eyewear (whoa)
Wait a minute, bitch, let me lie here (uh)
20/20 hindsight in my side mirror
Every year, you drop the ball like Times Square
My hair trigger whenever I get an idea's
Like, fuck, now my name rings out like a sponge mop
And my drip was a drop
In the bucket, so that gun shot
You just heard just now in that one spot
Just came from the nine mil' that I just got
That's big bucks and I got a full money clip and I'm loaded
I ain't even mean to go the fuck off
And I'm still totally inappropriate with an opiate
Groping it while I'm holding it like a trophy
I'm hoping a little codeine'll get me OD'in'
Whoa, everything is slow, I begin to floating
I know that I'm getting loaded, the pen exploded
Hiroshima with the flows, a utopia
With the dope, I'm an OG, I'm like the G.O.A.T.
Here to get your goat little bit of sodium, it's assault
When I'm at the podium, at your throat, holy camoly
I'm in the zone with the shit I'm on
Get Imodium and a commode because nobody's even close
You're petroleum to plutonium, you're a phony
I'm at the crib with your ho
Got her at the pole like voting with no clothing
Stripped down to a toe ring and here we go with the gloating
I've got my nose in the air like a Boeing
Then I got into a little bit of an argument with her
So I took a little lick of a Klonopin at dinner
Then I hit her with the motherfucking ottoman and bit her
Then I shot her in the liver, delivered her to the bottom of the river (dope)
But I'm probably gon' jump in the water with her
With a wad of money 'cause I got a lot of it
And when it come to drippin', I be soppin' like a hundred mile an hour
Never runnin' out of either one of 'em, I gotta get it 'cause

And it goes from martian to human (from martian to human, yeah)
That's how the virus attacks (that's how the virus attacks)
They come at me with machine guns (at me with machine guns, brr)
Like trying to fight off a gnat
Still stackin' my chips, hoes
Higher than Shaq on his tiptoes
Atop the Empire State Buildin'
This shit is like child's play, childrеn
I will anni-nihilate, kill them
I'll fuck around and pile еight million
Dead little juveniles, wait, chill, then
I'll await my trial date 'til then (what?)
Ain't nothin' you say could ever trump (nah), mic, pencil get killed (yeah)
If you're hypersensitive, I wasn't referencin' the vice president, chill (chill)
I mean my penmanship at times tends to get ill, violence but with skill
That's why I hence when I write ends up
With the mic and pencil gettin' killed (haha, yeah, hold up)
And I'm still ride or die for the squad (yeah)
So you know which side that I'm on
If a battle line's ever drawn, but if I get involved
It'll be like K9's in a brawl
But not similar to Mike Vick at all
'Cause even if I don't have a dog in the fight
They ain't never gonna get rid of the fight in the dog (fight in the dog)
Got stripes like a tiger, so you might get mauled, a mic in the palms
Like claws, I can swing right for your jaw
And rip it off with one swipe of the paw
Bitch, you still on my dick or nah? (Nah)
If I suck, your wife is a straw (straw)
I'm sick and I'm not gonna cover my mouth next time that I cough 'cause
They say these bars are like COVID (bars are like COVID, what?)
You get 'em right off the bat (you get 'em right off the bat, yeah)

They come at me with machine guns (at me with machine guns, brr)
Like trying to fight off a gnat
And d.a. got that dope he sends to me (uh-huh)
It's like pneumonia symptoms and contracting COVID instantly
Which is what separates my flow from theirs
So that no one gets even close to this to pose a risk to me
So vocalistically (what?), that's social distancing (yeah)
Flow going viral, you best stay strapped
With that Lysol and get way back (shh)
Get that Pine-Sol and that Ajax
'Cause this dry cough is just like football umpires callin' a playback
Bitch, back the fuck up like 15 yards
These rhymes call for a face mask (face mask)
'Nother 14-day quarantine, they're cordoning off everything
This shit lookin' like a horror scene, like me metaphorically (damn)
'Cause them stay-at-home orders seem
Like they just keep getting more extreme
Who knows when this night-Marilyn
Like Monroe, Norma Jean (Norma Jean)
Still got that heroin lyrical drip with that morphine and that Thorazine
'Cause I'm so fuckin' dope (dope) and you're a fiend
And that's the one thing that hasn't changed (nope)
For some semblance of normalcy
But I might need that Hydrochloroquine 'cause I got that (yeah)
The Dark Horse, I'm a knight-mare
Mom fed me Valium like air (mmm)
Thought that's why they called it a high chair (whoa)
I got a contact like eyewear (whoa)
Wait a minute, bitch, let me lie here (uh)
20/20 hindsight in my side mirror
Every year, you drop the ball like Times Square
My hair trigger whenever I get an idea's
Like, fuck, now my name rings out like a sponge mop
And my drip was a drop
In the bucket, so that gun shot
You just heard just now in that one spot
Just came from the nine mil' that I just got
That's big bucks and I got a full money clip and I'm loaded
I ain't even mean to go the fuck off
And I'm still totally inappropriate with an opiate
Groping it while I'm holding it like a trophy
I'm hoping a little codeine'll get me OD'in'
Whoa, everything is slow, I begin to floating
I know that I'm getting loaded, the pen exploded
Hiroshima with the flows, a utopia
With the dope, I'm an OG, I'm like the G.O.A.T.
Here to get your goat little bit of sodium, it's assault
When I'm at the podium, at your throat, holy camoly
I'm in the zone with the shit I'm on
Get Imodium and a commode because nobody's even close
You're petroleum to plutonium, you're a phony
I'm at the crib with your ho
Got her at the pole like voting with no clothing
Stripped down to a toe ring and here we go with the gloating
I've got my nose in the air like a Boeing
Then I got into a little bit of an argument with her
So I took a little lick of a Klonopin at dinner
Then I hit her with the motherfucking ottoman and bit her
Then I shot her in the liver, delivered her to the bottom of the river (dope)
But I'm probably gon' jump in the water with her
With a wad of money 'cause I got a lot of it
And when it come to drippin', I be soppin' like a hundred mile an hour
Never runnin' out of either one of 'em, I gotta get it 'cause
They say these bars are like COVID (bars are like COVID, what?)

"They say these bars are like COVID, you get 'em right off the bat
Infected with SARS and Corona, like you took a bite off of that
Then it goes from martian to human, that's how the virus attacks
They come at me with machine guns, like trying to fight off a gnat

Still stacking my chips, hoes, higher than Shaq on his tip-toes
Atop the Empire State Building, this shit is like child's play, children
I will anni-nihilate, kill them, I'll f**k around and pile eight million
Dead little juveniles, wait, chill, then I'll await my trial date 'till then
Ain't nothin' you say can ever trump, mic, pencil get killed
If you're hypersensitive, I wasn't referencing the vice president, chill
I mean my penmanship at times tends to get ill, violence but with skill
That's why I hence when I write ends up with the mic and pencil gettin' killed
And I'm still ride or die for the squad
So you know which side that I'm on
If a battle line's ever drawn, but if I get involved
It'll be like K9's in a brawl, but not similar to Mike Vick at all
'Cause even if I don't have a dog in the fight
They ain't never gonna get rid of the fight in the dog
Got stripes like a tiger, so you might get mauled, a mic in the palms
Like claws, I can swing right for your jaw and rip it off with one swipe of the paw
Bitch, you still on my dick or naw? If I suck, your wife is a straw
I'm sick and I'm not gonna cover my mouth next time that I cough 'cause...

They say these bars are like COVID, you get 'em right off the bat
Infected with SARS and Corona, like you took a bite off of that
Then it goes from martian to human, that's how the virus attacks
They come at me with machine guns, like trying to fight off a gnat

And d.a. got that dope he sends to me (Uh-huh)
It's like pneumonia symptoms and contracting COVID instantly
Which is what separates my flow from theirs
so that no one gets even close to this to pose a risk to me
So vocalistically, that's social distancing
Flow going viral, you best stay strapped with that Lysol and get way back
Get that Pine-Sol and that Ajax 'cause this dry cough is just like football umpires callin' a playback
Bitch, back the f**k up like fifteen yards, these rhymes call for a face mask
'Nother fourteen-day quarantine, they're cordoning off everything
This shit lookin' like a horror scene, like me metaphorically
'Cause them stay-at-home orders seem like they just keep getting more extreme
Who knows when this nightmare will end? Like Monroe, Norma Jean
Still got that heroin lyrical drip with that morphine and that Thorazine
'Cause I'm so f**kn' dope... and you're a fiend
And that's the one thing that hasn't changed, for some semblance of normalcy
But I might need that Hydrochloroquine 'cause I got that

The Dark Horse, I'm a knight-mare, Mom fed me Valium like air
Thought that's why they called it a high chair, I got a contact like eyewear
Woah, wait a minute, bitch, let me lie here, 20/20 hindsight in my side mirror
Every year, you drop the ball like Times Square, my hair trigger whenever I get an idea
F**k, now my name rings out like a sponge mop and my drip was a drop
In the bucket, so that gun shot, you just heard just now in that one spot
Just came from the nine mil' that I just got, that's big bucks and I got 
A full money clip and I'm loaded, I ain't even mean to go the f**k off

I'm still totally inappropriate with an opiate
Groping it while I'm holding it like a trophy
I'm hoping a little codeine'll get me OD'ing
Woah, everything is slow, I begin to floating
I know that I'm getting loaded, the pen exploded
Hiroshima with the flows, a utopia
With the dope, I'm an OG, I'm like the G.O.A.T.
Here to get your goat little bit of sodium, it's assault
When I'm at the podium, at your throat, holy camoly
I'm in the zone with the shit I'm on
Get Imodium and a commode because nobody's even close
You're petroleum to plutonium, you're a phony
I'm at the crib with your ho, got her at the pole like voting with no clothing
Stripped down to a toe ring and here we go with the gloating
I've got my nose in the air like a Boeing
Then I got into a little bit of an argument with her
So I took a little lick of a Klonopin at dinner
Then I hit her with the motherfucking ottoman and bit her
Then I shot her in the liver, delivered her to the bottom of the river
But I'm probably gon' jump in the water with her
With a wad of money 'cause I got a lot of it
And when it come to drippin', I be soppin' like a hundred mile an hour
Never runnin' out of either one of 'em, I gotta get it 'cause

Still got that heroin lyrical drip with that morphine and that Thorazine
'Cause I'm so fuckin' dope (dope) and you're a fiend
And that's the one thing that hasn't changed (nope)
For some semblance of normalcy

But I might need that Hydrochloroquine 'cause I got that (yeah)
The Dark Horse, I'm a knight-mare
Mom fed me Valium like air (mmm)
Thought that's why they called it a high chair (whoa)
I got a contact like eyewear (whoa)
Wait a minute, bitch, let me lie here (uh)
20/20 hindsight in my side mirror
Every year, you drop the ball like Times Square
My hair trigger whenever I get an idea's

Like, fuck, now my name rings out like a sponge mop
And my drip was a drop
In the bucket, so that gun shot
You just heard just now in that one spot
Just came from the nine mil' that I just got
That's big bucks and I got a full money clip and I'm loaded
I ain't even mean to go the fuck off

And I'm still totally inappropriate with an opiate
Groping it while I'm holding it like a trophy
I'm hoping a little codeine'll get me OD'in'
Whoa, everything is slow, I begin to floating
I know that I'm getting loaded, the pen exploded
Hiroshima with the flows, a utopia
With the dope, I'm an OG, I'm like the G.O.A.T.
Here to get your goat little bit of sodium, it's assault
When I'm at the podium, at your throat, holy camoly

I'm in the zone with the shit I'm on
Get Imodium and a commode because nobody's even close
You're petroleum to plutonium, you're a phony
I'm at the crib with your ho
Got her at the pole like voting with no clothing
Stripped down to a toe ring and here we go with the gloating
I've got my nose in the air like a Boeing

Then I got into a little bit of an argument with her
So I took a little lick of a Klonopin at dinner
Then I hit her with the motherfucking ottoman and bit her
Then I shot her in the liver, delivered her to the bottom of the river (dope)
But I'm probably gon' jump in the water with her
With a wad of money 'cause I got a lot of it
And when it come to drippin', I be soppin' like a hundred mile an hour
Never runnin' out of either one of 'em, I gotta get it 'cause",-0.9946,Negative,-0.059327777777777785,Negative,-0.42808231711387634,Negative

"This verse single handedly cemented Eminem as at least Top 5 Rappers of all time, and at this point he is fighting for the #1 spot in my mind. Only rappers that I seen come close to this skill level are Jay-Z, Biggie, Nas, Crazy Bone, and I can't think of much more lol... Also I think the argument of ""can a white person rap"" is 6 feet under... I can write lyrics like this but even AFTER deciphering like 95% of what he said, I still can barely get it out at the speed and flow this man did... Will the real Slim Shady please stand up! Hats off, definitely 🐐 material!

I want to say that you are 1 of my 2 all time favorite Idols! Sadly, Paul Walker🙏🏼 God rest his Soul was my other idol and he will be missed for dear life by many. You both have inspired me to love music and not drive boring cars. It has been a dream since I was so young to meet you and or Paul. I have asked my parents for years to help me get the once In a life time Opportunity to meet my Only living Idol. Im am not longer that 10 yr old with that dream. I am 27 now and I still admire you and your work/music today. It would be a dream come true. You have gotten me through soo much in my life! I CAN NOT Thank you enough for that. I have also been killing most of your music since the day I could it fluently. Ive always been pretty good at your flow. A bit rough still but! Ive had a very rough childhood in the foster system. Needless to say if It wasnt for you, I wouldnt be wear I am today. I know theres millions of other that idol you everyday. That is the best part of being who are today. You might not realize it but there lots people you have saved and Im happy that I got to be part of this journey. Keep making music please. We all love you Eminem. Hope to meet you one day. Id love to tell my children one day that I met you.",0.9943,Positive,0.16541666666666666,Netural,0.7930889129638672,Positive

4 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;
2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;
3 Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.
4 For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:",0.7775,Positive,0.31666666666666665,Netural,0.45578107237815857,Positive
