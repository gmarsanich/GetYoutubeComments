"This is one of those songs that so well describes a lot of mental issues. Depression and anxiety in particular, it's pretty common that those who suffer from it put on a tough facade so as not to worry their friends and family (or out of fear that if those close to them knew how much they were struggling to keep acting like everything was okay, and how close they always were to breaking, they would leave). That's why a lot of friends and family of those who choose to end it say ""I never even knew they were struggling!""

"I'm not the elder brother or anything like that, as everyone likes to refer to. But I feel like this song also talks to people with terrible social anxiety or people who have very high standards about others and themselves. My everyday life is dictated by ""Am I going to be good enough?"", and that's why I can relate so much to this song. Not because of the family pressure, but the social pressure we all suffer from. We're expected to be the best person possible every single minute of our lives.... but we can't. And it terrifies us. Because letting people down or being laughed at for not being worthy are horrible feelings... But we're human...

"I normally don't post but I am the youngest of my family and both my parents went through home hospice \ home care... first my mom with stage 4 ovarian cancer, and then my father with kidney failure and dialysis. I spent time taking care of both of them. First my mom passed in 2017 and then my father on my mom's birthday in 2019. I asked siblings for help and was very frequently denied because it was an inconvenience for them to take my father on the weekends or come to help me with my mom on the weekends. I balanced this alongside my 3 children and wife's needs and running my household...

I spent 5 years until 2021 living in the 2:32 to 2:52 timeframe. Unsure how or what changed my insanely depressive mindstate after my father's passing, but all I can say is please appreciate the siblings helping, and understand that mental health is a thing. I was a straw away from not being here and I've never thought like that in my life ever.",-0.3884,Negative,-0.0929629629629629,Negative,0.3965981304645538,Positive

"I rarely ever see a non-slender woman play a role in a movie other than as comic relief, and this film went beyond that: it had her sing an incredibly moving song. This is the best.

"This song was just….I mean you can tell that it was going to be a strong song and it didn’t disappoint. The lyrics summoned up not just her feelings, but the some of the others in the movie. This movie had me crying, getting mad, and just messed up in general.  I know Disney makes movies that can bring forth emotions, but this hit hard. It can actually go for those that have siblings, but for people in general.  We all are under pressure, but the minute that you show some kind of weakness or admit that you need help, people look at you as if you are a failure. It shouldn’t be that way. Everyone needs help sometime and it is good to have people you can turn to and ask for help without judgement. In that family…good luck. Well, I think the grandmother would be the only one that would look at people funny since she was kinda the cause of all of this in the first place.",0.4516,Positive,0.0419642857142857,Neutral,-0.473812848329544,Negative

"I'm the strong one, I'm not nervous
I'm as tough as the crust of the earth is
I move mountains, I move churches
And I glow, 'cause I know what my worth is
I don't ask how hard the work is
Got a rough, indestructible surface
Diamonds and platinum, I find 'em, I flatten 'em
I take what I'm handed, I break what's demanded, but

Under the surface
I feel berserk as a tightrope walker in a three-ring circus
Under the surface
Was Hercules ever like, ""Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus""?
Under the surface
I'm pretty sure I'm worthless if I can't be of service
A flaw or a crack, the straw in the stack
That breaks the camel's back
What breaks the camel's back? It's

Pressure like a drip, drip, drip, that'll never stop, whoa-oh
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's older
Give her all the heavy things we can't shoulder
Who am I if I can't run with the ball?
If I fall to
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, whoa-oh
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's stronger
See if she can hang on a little longer
Who am I if I can't carry it all?
If I falter

Under the surface
I hide my nerves and it worsens, I worry somethin' is gonna hurt us
Under the surface
The ship doesn't swerve as it heard how big the iceberg is
Under the surface
I think about my purpose, can I somehow preserve this?
Line up the dominoes, a light wind blows
You try to stop it tumblin', but on and on it goes

But wait, if I could shake, the crushing weight
Of expectations, would that free some room up for joy
Or relaxation, or simple pleasure?
Instead, we measure this growing pressure (pressure)
Keeps growing (pressure), keep going (pressure), 'cause all we know is

Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, whoa-oh
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, it doesn't hurt and
See if she can handle every family burden
Watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks
No mistakes, just
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, whoa-oh
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Give it to your sister and never wonder
If the same pressure would've pulled you under
Who am I if I don't have what it takes?
No cracks, no breaks
No mistakes!

"I'm the strong one, I'm not nervous
I'm as tough as the crust of the earth is
I move mountains, I move churches
And I glow, 'cause I know what my worth is
I don't ask how hard the work is
Got a rough, indestructible surface
Diamonds and platinum, I find 'em, I flatten 'em
I take what I'm handed, I break what's demanded, but

Under the surface
I feel berserk as a tightrope walker in a three-ring circus
Under the surface
Was Hercules ever like, ""Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus""?
Under the surface
I'm pretty sure I'm worthless if I can't be of service
A flaw or a crack, the straw in the stack
That breaks the camel's back
What breaks the camel's back? It's

Pressure like a drip, drip, drip, that'll never stop, whoa-oh
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's older
Give her all the heavy things we can't shoulder
Who am I if I can't run with the ball?
If I fall to
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, whoa-oh
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's stronger
See if she can hang on a little longer
Who am I if I can't carry it all?
If I falter

Under the surface
I hide my nerves and it worsens, I worry somethin' is gonna hurt us
Under the surface
The ship doesn't swerve as it heard how big the iceberg is
Under the surface
I think about my purpose, can I somehow preserve this?
Line up the dominoes, a light wind blows
You try to stop it tumblin', but on and on it goes

But wait, if I could shake, the crushing weight
Of expectations, would that free some room up for joy
Or relaxation, or simple pleasure?
Instead, we measure this growing pressure (pressure)
Keeps growing (pressure), keep going (pressure), 'cause all we know is

Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, whoa-oh
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, it doesn't hurt and
See if she can handle every family burden
Watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks
No mistakes, just
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, whoa-oh
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Give it to your sister and never wonder
If the same pressure would've pulled you under
Who am I if I don't have what it takes?
No cracks, no breaks
No mistakes!
No pressure!",0.983,Positive,0.0946338383838383,Neutral,-0.3187556564807892,Negative

"I love how this song has so many subtle uses of... Everything.

Like in the beginning when she sings ""I take what I'm handed, I break what's demanded"" it could also be read ""I take what I'm handed, I break, what's demanded?"" which is also what the whole song is about.

Then when she sings that dominos line up and a light wind blows, but we see it as a tornado. For me this symbolizes how small things are big for her simply because she is already at her breaking point.

But also how when the tornado sucks them all up comes a moment of relief. This after her actually having failed to prevent, stop or protect Mirabel from the tornado. Even in this there would be a release, to be freed from always having to succeed and taking on it all. The freedom that comes with failure to live up to expectations, but this is in contrast of the pressure to live up to expectations and that pressure is stronger than the desired freedom in failing.

Then in the end when catching the rocks and she sings ""pressure like a drip-drip-drip that never stops"" and the look on her face. For me that is a look of resignation, how she feel powerless to change things and how the only option she got is to keep going, otherwise she will fail them all and they might get hurt.

Then there's the line ""watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks"". Hard things doesn't buckle and bend without breaking, hard things break when they bend. Soft things buckle and break but doesn't break under pressure, another way to symbolize that she is soft beneath the surface that she present as hard.

Then there are all the moments of overt and subtle anger. Anger generally a feeling you have when feeling unjustly treated or when something important is threatened, for example a loved one or your image of yourself. We get to see a lot of anger in the intro, before she reveals what's beneath the surface. Mirabel poking is threatening her to face that she doesn't feel confident in her ability to live up to the image others have of her and/or that she feels unjustly treated in never getting to say no nor really getting anything in return for all her efforts. After this the anger is rarely present, during the main part it's anxiety I hear in her voice. A few exceptions exist though, like when she says the word ""blow"" in ""a light wind blows"", this wind is another threat or unjust treatment/burden. And we also hear the anger come back in the end during the phrase ""watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks"". Could be interpreted as she feels like the others (should) see how burdened she is but not caring even if she is at her breaking point, thus unjustly treated.

And anger is something that is often described as ""pressure building up"" if you don't have any way of acting on it. In this case ""acting on anger"" could be as simple as saying no or like how Mirabel by the end when she uses her anger of feeling unjustly treated to overcome her fear and anxiety of being thrown out from the family if she stands up against grandma. But if you never get to act upon you anger it tends to build up like a pressure that will eventually explode. So I can easily see how Luisa would sooner or later have some kind of break down or melt down if things had just kept going as normal. Same can be said for Isabella even though her anger and situation express themselves differently and a topic for itself.

One last note, you could also see how the part with the geysers and how Mirabel lands on one of them as a symbol of her fear that the pressure she's building up is gone blow up and hurt those she care about, thus being constantly on the watch for external threats as well as internal. And this could be why she seem to have a (of lately at least) habit to get going and doing chores as quickly as possible to avoid the risk of a geyser exploding and hurting those she love. This can also be seen when she sings about the drip that ""makes you pop"".",-0.9984,Negative,-0.075161773989899,Negative,0.3769091963768005,Positive

"“I’m pretty sure I’m worthless if I can’t be of service”
This song can honestly hit hard even if you're the youngest. Because sometimes when you're the youngest it's real easy to get lost in a crowd amongst relatives. You're just the baby, nobody listens to you or takes you seriously. So you feel the need to be useful, to not let yourself seem weak or incapable, to shoulder as much, because if you aren't useful then you're just a burden... You feel obligated to be useful because you tie your own self worth to how capable you are and whether or not you can be a person that everyone else can rely upon, you never want to seem weak or small because then you're just the baby again...",0.121,Positive,0.1044117647058823,Neutral,-0.3648220300674438,Negative
