"I broke up with my boyfriend of almost 4 years, a few months ago. His best friend, who I'm also close with, told me a few days ago that my ex had confided in him that a year and a half ago he was conflicted between two women. It turns out that he had fallen in love with her and didn't know who he wanted to be with. He said he fell in love with her because she was there for him when no one else was. I was always there for him, more than what he ever was for me. It happened a year and a half ago, but I just found out so it feels like it just happened. I'm not sure if she was aware he was in a relationship or not.",0.7816,Positive,0.1766666666666667,Netural,0.4075436294078827,Positive

Ooh I think the red is supposed to symbolize regret/ doubt that’s why as he thinks about her more his wedding turns red but in his brief fantasy she’s dressed in white before reality crashed back in.

"The person I'm in love with for almost 3 years is now getting married. Just found out recently (thru my own powers). He never told me anything about it whenever we're together and I also asked him many times before about his relationships, I never got a direct answer.  It turns out they were 2years engaged but still seeing me at the same time. It hurts so much when I realized that I was just a plaything or pastime for him. The worst thing is, he never had an intention to tell me and just ghosted me (lowkey) because now that they were getting married this year. I feel so pathetic, ashamed, disgusted with myself, and also feel sorry for the girl that I had no intention of hurting. This song just helps me cope somehow, it feels like it was written for me.  Thank you, Taylor! you have written almost every song for different kinds of heartbreaks </3 that we can relate to.

Kane Brown and Khalid they both can't sing squat.  Their voices are not marketable.  Their albums are not sellable.   Never on pitch and can't even carry a tune.  I wouldn't go to their concerts even if they pay me....people literally fall asleep during their concerts.    We are fed up with their mediocre performances at CMA awards.  They should be permanently banned from American music industry,-0.1027,Negative,-0.25,Negative,-0.9096149206161499,Negative
