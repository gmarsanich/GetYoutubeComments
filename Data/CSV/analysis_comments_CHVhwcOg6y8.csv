One time
One time

When I met you girl my heart went knock knock knock
Now them butterflies in my stomach won't stop stop
And even though it's a struggle love is all we got
So we gonna keep keep climbin' till the mountain top

Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
My breath is your breath
And your heart (is my heart)

You're my one love
My one heart
My one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
And I'ma be your one guy
You'll be my number one girl always makin' time for you
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)

You look so deep
You know that it humbles me
You're by my side and what troubles them don't trouble me
Many have called but the chosen is you
Whatever you want shawty I'll give it to you

Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
My breath is your breath
And your heart (is my heart)

You're my one love
My one heart
My one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
And I'ma be your one guy
You'll be my number one girl always makin' time for you
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)

Shawty right there
She's got everything I need and I'ma tell her one time
One time, one time
Give you everything you need down to my last dime
She makes me happy
I know where I'll be
Right by your side 'cause she is the one
For me

You're my one love
My one heart
My one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
And I'ma be your one guy

One time
When I met you girl my heart went knock knock knock
Now them butterflies in my stomach won't stop stop
And even though it's a struggle love is all we got
So we gonna keep keep climbin' till the mountain top
Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
My breath is your breath
And your heart (is my heart)
You're my one love
My one heart
My one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
And I'ma be your one guy
You'll be my number one girl always makin' time for you
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
You look so deep
You know that it humbles me
You're by my side and what troubles them don't trouble me
Many have called but the chosen is you
Whatever you want shawty I'll give it to you
Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
My breath is your breath
And your heart (is my heart)
You're my one love
My one heart
My one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
And I'ma be your one guy
You'll be my number one girl always makin' time for you
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
Shawty right there
She's got everything I need and I'ma tell her one time
One time, one time
Give you everything you need down to my last dime
She makes me happy
I know where I'll be
Right by your side 'cause she is the one
For me
You're my one love
My one heart
My one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
And I'ma be your one guy
You'll be my number one girl always makin' time for you
I'ma me tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
Me plus you, I'ma tell you one time
Me plus you, I'ma tell you one time
Me plus you, I'ma tell you one time
One time

Okay… Not to be a downer or anything but I just wanted to say this and put this out there. As a young black female I used to be talked about because I listened to some of his songs and actually liked them. And I just recently realized now that I’m older one of the main reasons why I liked them ( ESPECIALLY this song in particular) is because how he talked about females in his music because the “boys” AND “men”  in the black community would never or hardly talk about a female the way he does in this song especially a black woman. It actually made me feel valued for more than just the physical.,0.9052,Positive,0.0789215686274509,Positive,0.8702139258384705,Positive
