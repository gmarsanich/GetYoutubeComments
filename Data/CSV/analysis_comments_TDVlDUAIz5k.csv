To those who weren‚Äôt around for or wondering what happened with ‚ÄúInvincible‚Äù: the album‚Äôs promotion was cut a few weeks after its release by Sony. Michael was thinking of moving MJJ to another home because of their differences and that was their response. ‚ÄúInvincible‚Äù went multi-platinum on the strength of ‚ÄúYou Rock My World‚Äù alone but his plans of more singles and videos were cut short; as a result we didn‚Äôt get another awesome 4-year MJ ‚Äúera‚Äù.

"Heaven Can Wait Lyrics
[Chorus]
Tell the angels no, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

[Verse 1]
You're beautiful, you're wonderful
Incredible, I love you so
You're beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you girl it's incredible
And I don't know what I'd do, if I can't be with you
The world could not go on so every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn't wanna go if I can't see your face, can't hold you close
What good would Heaven be
If the angels came for me I'd tell them no

[Chorus]
Tell the angels no, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait


[Verse 2]
Unthinkable
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you'd be moving on
I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Can't stand to see nobody kissing, touching her
Couldn't take nobody loving you the way we were
What good would Heaven be
If the angels come for me I'd tell them no

[Chorus]
Tell the angels no, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
(My bay-beah!)
I don't want nobody else to hold you
(Don't you do this do me!)
That's a chance I'll take
(If the angels come around!)
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
(Just tell them to bring me down to my baby!)
No, if the angels took me from this earth
(Don't you do this do me!)
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

[Verse 3]
Oh no, can't be without my baby
(I can't be without my baby!)
Won't go, without her, I'd go crazy
(You can't do this to me!)
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
(See, if the angels come around, just tell them to bring me down, to my baby!)
Ooh
Oh no, can't be without my baby
(Don't you do this do me!)
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy
(I can't be without my baby!)
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
(I love you, girl! I need you, baby! I want you, baby!)
Ooh
[Chorus]
No, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

[Outro]
Leave us alone
Just leave us alone
(You're beautiful, you‚Äôre wonderful, incredible, I love you so)
Leave us alone
Please leave us alone
(You‚Äôre beautiful)
Please leave us alone
Oh, leave me alone
Please leave me alone
I said leave me alone",0.9981,Positive,0.4028298611111111,Positive,0.4454076290130615,Positive

"Tell the angels no!
I don't want to leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay
Heaven can wait
No!
If the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take
Maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

You're beautiful
You're wonderful!
Incredible!
I love you so!

You're beautiful!
Each moment spent with you is simple wonderful
This love I have for you girl it's incredible
And I don't know what I'd do
If I can't be with you
The world could not go on so every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn't want to go
If I can't see your face
Can't hold you close
What good would Heaven be?
If the angels came for me I'd tell them no

I don't want to leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay
Heaven can wait
No!
If the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take
Maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

Unthinkable
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you'd be moving on (Moving on)
I'd turn it all around
And try to get back down to my baby girl
Can't stand to see nobody kissing, touching her!
Couldn't take nobody loving you the way we were!
What good would Heaven be?
If the angels come for me I'd tell them no

No!
I don't want to leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay
Heaven can wait
No!
If the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take
Maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

Oh no!
Can't be without my baby!
Won't go!
Without her I'd go crazy!
Oh no!
Guess Heaven will be waiting!
Ooh!
Oh no!
Can't be without my baby
Won't go!
Without her I'd go crazy!
Oh no!
Guess Heaven will be waiting!
Ooh!

No!
I don't want to leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay
Heaven can wait
No!
If the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take
Maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait (no)

Just leave us alone

"Tell the angels no!
I don't want to leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay
Heaven can wait
No!
If the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take
Maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait
You're beautiful
You're wonderful!
Incredible!
I love you so!
You're beautiful!
Each moment spent with you is simple wonderful
This love I have for you girl it's incredible
And I don't know what I'd do
If I can't be with you
The world could not go on so every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn't want to go
If I can't see your face
Can't hold you close
What good would Heaven be?
If the angels came for me I'd tell them no
I don't want to leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay
Heaven can wait
No!
If the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take
Maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait
Unthinkable
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you'd be moving on (Moving on)
I'd turn it all around
And try to get back down to my baby girl
Can't stand to see nobody kissing, touching her!
Couldn't take nobody loving you the way we were!
What good would Heaven be?
If the angels come for me I'd tell them no
No!
I don't want to leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay
Heaven can wait
No!
If the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take
Maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait
Oh no!
Can't be without my baby!
Won't go!
Without her I'd go crazy!
Oh no!
Guess Heaven will be waiting!
Ooh!
Oh no!
Can't be without my baby
Won't go!
Without her I'd go crazy!
Oh no!
Guess Heaven will be waiting!
Ooh!
No!
I don't want to leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay
Heaven can wait
No!
If the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take
Maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait (no)
Just leave us alone

"""Heaven Can Wait""

[Chorus:]
Tell the angels no, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

You're beautiful, you're wonderful, incredible, I love you so...

You're beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you girl it's incredible
And I don't know what I'd do, if I can't be with you
The world could not go on so every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn't wanna go if I can't see your face, can't hold you close
What good would Heaven be
If the angels came for me I'd tell them no

[Chorus]

Unthinkable
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you'd be moving on
I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Can't stand to see nobody kissing, touching her
Couldn't take nobody loving you the way we were
What good would Heaven be
If the angels come for me I'd tell them no

[Chorus]

Oh no, can't be without my baby
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
Ooh
Oh no, can't be without my baby
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
Ooh

[Chorus]

Just leave us alone, leave us alone
Please leave us alone",0.9931,Positive,0.3997222222222222,Positive,0.5560840964317322,Positive
