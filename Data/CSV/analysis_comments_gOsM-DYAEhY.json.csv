Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible

Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working onto something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes",0.9947,Positive,0.185663082437276,Netural,-0.6956048011779785,Negative

"LYRICS

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist

Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah take me to the top I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible

Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of them
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system of catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins

"LYRICS FRENCH and English

Imagine Dragons

""Whatever It Takes""
Peu importe ce qu'il en coûte

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Je tombe trop vite pour m'y préparer
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Trébucher dans le monde pourrait être dangereux
Everybody circling, it's vulturous
Tout le monde m'encercle, tels des vautours
Negative, nepotist
Négatif, népotisme

Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Tout le monde attend la chute d'un homme
Everybody praying for the end of times
Tout le monde prie pour la fin des temps
Everybody hoping they could be the one
Tout le monde espère qu'ils pourront être l'élu
I was born to run, I was born for this
Je suis né pour courir, je suis né pour ça

Whip, whip
Cravache, cravache
Run me like a racehorse
Fais-moi courir comme un cheval de course
Hold me like a ripcord
Tiens-moi comme une corde de parachute*
Break me down and build me up
Détruis-moi et reconstruis-moi
I wanna be the slip, slip
Je veux être la chute, chute
Word upon your lip, lip
Le mot sur tes lèvres, lèvres
Letter that you rip, rip
La lettre que tu arraches, arraches
Break me down and build me up
Détruis-moi et reconstruis-moi

Whatever it takes
Peu importe ce qu'il en coûte
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
Parce que j'aime l'adrénaline dans mes veines
I do whatever it takes
Je ferai tout ce qu'il faut
Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Parce que j'aime la sensation quand je brise les chaînes
Whatever it takes
Peu importe ce qu'il en coûte
You take me to the top I'm ready for
Tu m'emmènes au sommet, je suis prêt pour
Whatever it takes
Tout ce qu'il en coûte
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
Parce que j'aime l'adrénaline dans mes veines
I do what it takes
Je ferai ce qu'il faut

Always had a fear of being typical
J'ai toujours eu peur d'être habituel
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Regardant mon corps en me sentant misérable
Always hanging on to the visual
Toujours accroché au visuel
I wanna be invisible
Je voudrais être invisible

Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Regardant mes années passées comme un martyre
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Tout le monde a besoin d'en faire partie
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
Jamais être assez, je suis le fils prodigue
I was born to run, I was born for this
Je suis né pour courir, je suis né pour ça

Hypocritical, egotistical
Hypocrite, égoïste
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Je veux pas être le ""entre parenthèse"", l'hypothétique
Working onto something that I'm proud of, out of the box
Travaillant sur quelque chose dont je suis fier, d'original
An hypoxya to the world and the vision we've lost
Une hypoxie pour le monde et la vision que nous en avons perdu
I'm an apostrophe
Je suis une apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
Je suis juste un symbole qui vous rappelle qu'il y a plus à voir
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
Je suis juste un produit du système, une catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half diseased
Et pourtant un chef-d'oeuvre, et pourtant je suis à moitié malade
And when I am deceased
Et quand je serai mort
At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Au moins je descendrai dans la tombe et mourrai heureux
Leave the body of my soul to be a part of me
Laissez le corps de mon âme être une partie de moi

"Falling too fast to prepare for this         Lyrics
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, ripBreak me down and build me up
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah take me to the top I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veinsI do what it takes
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of them
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system of catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
