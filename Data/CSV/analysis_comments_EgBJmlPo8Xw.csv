"Lyrics:

 I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm being honest

It might have been a nightmare
To anyone who might care

Thought I could fly
So I stepped off the golden
Nobody cried
Nobody even noticed

I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say
As long as I'm here
No one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here
But you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
""They don't deserve you""

I tried to scream
But my head was under water
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter

Could've been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say
As long as I'm here
No one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here
But you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
""They don't deserve you""

"Demonic music is an abomination to God. God, Jesus loves you all so much and wants you to turn away from anything evil that would distract you from Him. Time is short, Judgment on the world is approaching. Jesus Christ wants to have a relationship with you. Repentance of any and all sin (cheating, lying, adultery, sex outside of marriage, pornography, using the Lords name in vain...are all sin and must be repented of and turned away from). You may or may not believe in this, but Hell and Heaven are two REAL places. If you deny God and His goodness and turn to the ""evil one"" satan, you will find your place in Hell. you will experience Extreme torture much more intense then any torture here on earth, and for eternity (that means forever without stop). Satan uses demonic music to influence listeners. DO NOT OPEN THOSE DOORS by participating.",-0.9845,Negative,-0.048076923076923,Negative,-0.4386469423770904,Negative

The images, although they aren't owned by me but taken from the web, are often related to the song that I choose or that is requested.

This video breaks my heart 😔 I have twin sisters that struggle with suicide and I fight every second of everyday for them to live and not give up. It's the hardest thing in life to deal with. And reading the comments are so sad because so many people see comfort in going out like this. But God says THIS IS NOT THE WAY! All I can continue to do is pray and give it to God. To my twin sisters Patty & LuLu I love you both with everything I have. And We WILL grow old together 😉😘,0.9485,Positive,0.0944805194805194,Neutral,0.3794737160205841,Positive

"I had a dream
Aku bermimpi
I got everything I wanted
Aku punya semua yang kuinginkan
Not what you'd think
Bukan seperti apa yang kamu pikirkan
And if I'm being honest
Dan jika aku berkata jujur

It might've been a nightmare
Itu mungkin adalah mimpi buruk
To anyone who might care
Untuk siapapun yang mungkin peduli
Thought I could fly (fly)
Kupikir aku bisa terbang
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Jadi aku melompat dari jembatan Golden Gate

Nobody cried (cried, cried, cried, cried)
Tidak seorangpun menangis
Nobody even noticed
Bahkan tidak seorangpun memperhatikan
I saw them standing right there
Aku melihat mereka berdiri di sana
Kinda thought they might care (might care, might care)
Kukira mereka mungkin peduli

I had a dream
Aku bermimpi
I got everything I wanted
Aku punya semua yang kuinginkan
But when I wake up, I see
Tapi saat aku terbangun, aku melihat
You with me
Kamu bersamaku

And you say, ""As long as I'm here
Dan kamu berkata, “Selama aku berada di sini
No one can hurt you
Tidak ada yang bisa menyakitimu
Don't wanna lie here
Tidak ingin berbaring di sini
But you can learn to
Tapi kamu bisa belajar
If I could change
Seandainya aku bisa mengubah
The way that you see yourself
Caramu memandang dirimu sendiri
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
Kamu tidak akan bertanya mengapa kamu mendengar
They don't deserve you""
Mereka tidak pantas mendapatkanmu”

I tried to scream
Aku berusaha untuk berteriak
But my head was underwater
Tapi kepalaku berada di bawah air
They called me weak
Mereka menyebutku lemah
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Seolah aku bukan anak siapa-siapa

Coulda been a nightmare
Bisa jadi itu adalah mimpi buruk
But it felt like they were right there
Tapi rasanya seperti mereka benar-benar ada di sana
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
Dan rasanya kemarin seperti setahun yang lalu
But I don't wanna let anybody know
Tapi aku tidak ingin memberitahu siapapun
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
Karena semua orang menginginkan sesuatu dariku
And I don't wanna let 'em down
Dan aku tidak ingin mengecewakan mereka

I had a dream
Aku bermimpi
I got everything I wanted
Aku punya semua yang kuinginkan
But when I wake up, I see
Tapi saat aku terbangun, aku melihat
You with me
Kamu bersamaku

And you say, ""As long as I'm here
Dan kamu berkata, “Selama aku berada di sini
No one can hurt you
Tidak ada yang bisa menyakitimu
Don't wanna lie here
Tidak ingin berbaring di sini
But you can learn to
Tapi kamu bisa belajar
If I could change
Seandainya aku bisa mengubah
The way that you see yourself
Caramu memandang dirimu sendiri
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
Kamu tidak akan bertanya mengapa kamu mendengar
They don't deserve you""
Mereka tidak pantas mendapatkanmu”

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm being honest

It might have been a nightmare
To anyone who might care

Thought I could fly
So I stepped off the golden
Nobody cried
Nobody even noticed

I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say
As long as I'm here
No one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here
But you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
""They don't deserve you""

I tried to scream
But my head was under water
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter

Could've been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream

But when I wake up, I see

I can't convey into words how cathartic both this song and video are to me. 

He's still with me, and I'm grateful for that...but not being able to phsyically hold his hand anymore hurts. A lot. To be honest, I still lose my breath at how sad I am sometimes.

"This is great. The music and the video, the whole picture. I swear this song is best enjoyed with the video, it adds so much to it. Don't get me wrong it's a good song but I feel like the video is such an important accompaniment too. It's one of those rare instances when the video isn't there just for the sake of it or just for promotion, but it's a vital part of the concept. Feels like the concept involves both visual and audio equally. The atmosphere built by the sounds used, the production, the lyrics, the singing and the imagery, the framing, the colors, the darkness, all of these things as a whole, it's a work of art. It conveys so much emotion with a lot of subtlety. It's very bleak, dark even claustrophobic at times, but somehow still very very human and comforting. It's so good. You just get the message. It's not the words, it's not the music nor the video, but all of those things combined together say something that is much easier felt than said. Amazing communicators these two.

"Billie likely won’t see this, but I was just at her concert for the happier than ever world tour and when she started singing this song, it brought me to tears. It makes me think about how much I love my family and friends, and how much they care about me. During a quiet part in her concert, a person yelled “You saved my life Billie” and everyone in the section cheered for them. She cares about her fans and has a connection to them. Thank you billie for being there for all of your fans even if you can’t directly express it. During the concert, she was checking on everyone. Once again, thank you Billie for being there and producing amazing music. All my respect and love to you. ❤️

"I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm being honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care

Thought I could fly (fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, hmm
Nobody cried
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say
""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear They don't deserve you""

I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Could've been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there

And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say
""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear They don't deserve you"" 

If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?

"Being rich and famous is not sinful. However, making that a primary pursuit in life is sinful. “People who long to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many foolish and harmful desires that plunge them into ruin and destruction” (1 Timothy 6:9, NLT). “Do not toil to acquire wealth” (Proverbs 23:4, ESV).

The world would have us believe that the only way to become rich and famous is to set goals and pursue them doggedly. The Bible paints a different picture. Consider three biblical figures whose examples speak to this issue:

1. First and foremost is Jesus. When tempted by Satan, He intentionally rejected the opportunities to become rich and famous (Matthew 4:1–11). Jesus devoted Himself to the tasks God gave Him (John 5:19). We are compelled to take the attitude of Jesus, “Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing. . . . He humbled himself” (Philippians 2:5–8).What was the result of Jesus’ humbling
Himself? “Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name” (verse 9).

2. Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers. As a slave, he had no ambitions to be rich and famous. He only did the work that was put before him. In Potiphar’s house, Joseph’s faithfulness resulted in his being put in charge of everything. Later, in jail, he helped his fellow prisoners, earning a trust that ultimately led to his being put in charge of all of Egypt, second only to Pharaoh. In short, Joseph focused on what God wanted him doing, and as a result he became one of the most powerful and famous men in the world (see Genesis 37—41).

3. He was not wealthy, but the apostle Paul was perhaps the most famous Christian ever to live. How did his fame become worldwide and timeless? He simply did what God put him on earth to do: make disciples. He certainly had a claim to worldly fame, describing some of his accomplishments in Philippians 3:4–6. Yet what did he think about these pursuits that would have warranted fame? “Whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ” (verse 7). Paul’s ambition was never to become famous or gather the accolades of men. His burning ambition was to do God’s work and glorify Christ. That was his higher calling.

In Matthew 6:10–20, Jesus teaches us not store up treasures on earth, but in heaven. Then He says, “You cannot serve both God and money” (verse 24). And “Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things [the basic necessities of life] will be given to you as well” (verse 33). That is, stop trying to be rich and famous, and instead simply seek after God, living out His purposes for your life. If God wants earthly riches to come your way, they will.

For those whose ambition is to be rich, the Bible has many cautions. Jesus said that it is difficult for the rich to enter the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 19:24). Material wealth has a way of taking our eyes off of what’s important and eternal. Jesus’ parable of the rich fool in Luke 12:16–21 teaches that it is foolish to store up earthly things and take no thought of heavenly things.

As for pursuing fame, the Bible is equally cautioning: “Those who exalt themselves will be humbled” (Matthew 23:12). Paul says that “a person with a changed heart seeks praise from God, not from people” (Romans 2:29, NLT). James asks, “Don’t you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God” (James 4:4).

Those who are rich and famous often struggle to obey basic biblical commands such as “Be content with what you have” (Hebrews 13:5) and “Do not be proud, but enjoy the company of the lowly. Do not be conceited” (Romans 12:16, BSB) and “Now listen, you rich people, weep and wail because of the misery that is coming on you” (James 5:1).

To be clear, it’s not wrong to have wealth. It’s the love of money that is a root of all kinds of evil (1 Timothy 6:10). But those with wealth should understand where the wealth comes from (God), the purpose for having it (to further God’s work), and it’s transitory nature (see Proverbs 23:5).

Ecclesiastes 2:24 notes, “A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil.” But the same passage clarifies the Source of our blessings: “This too, I see, is from the hand of God, for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment?” (verses 24–25).

We should not make fame and fortune a primary pursuit in life. Rather, we should make glorifying God our primary goal. We love Jesus and obey Him (John 14:15). We follow Jesus, which means we deny ourselves, take up our cross, and follow wherever He leads (Mark 8:34). Jesus blesses the meek (Matthew 5:5); being rich and famous is not usually His plan for His children in this world.",0.9994,Positive,0.2321033696033696,Neutral,-0.3365891873836517,Negative
"Darkness and light are metaphors for evil and good. If anyone sees an angel of light, it will automatically seem to be a good being, for the correlation of evil with darkness, and of good with light, is a powerful archetype in human history. In the Bible, light is a spiritual metaphor for truth and God’s unchanging nature (James 1:17). It is repeatedly used in the Bible to help us understand that God is wholly good and truthful (1 John 1:5). When we are “in the light,” we are with Him (1 Peter 2:9). He exhorts us to join Him in the light (1 John 1:7), for giving us light was His purpose (John 12:46). Light is the place where love dwells and is comfortable (1 John 2:9-10). God has created light (Genesis 1:3), dwells in the light (1 Timothy 6:16) and puts the light in human hearts so that we can see and know Him and understand truth (2 Corinthians 4:6).

So, when 2 Corinthians 11:14 tells us that “Satan disguises himself as an angel of light,” it means that Satan capitalizes on our love of the light in order to deceive. He wants us to think that he is good, truthful, loving, and powerful – all the things that God is. To portray himself as a dark, devilish being with horns would not be very appealing to the majority of people. Most people are not drawn to darkness, but to light. Therefore, Satan appears as a creature of light to draw us to himself and his lies.

How can we discern which light is of God and which light is of Satan? Our minds and hearts are easily confused by conflicting messages. How can we make sure we are on the right path? Psalm 119 says, “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path” (verse 105) and “The unfolding of your words gives light; it imparts understanding to the simple” (verse 130). The words of God have power. Just as God’s voice spoke physical light into existence, it can speak spiritual light into our hearts. Exposure to His voice – in His Word – will help us recognize the difference between the good light of God and that which is counterfeit.

Satan presents sin to us as something pleasing and beautiful to be desired, and he presents false teaching as enlightening and life-changing. Millions follow his deceptions simply because they do not know God’s truth. Isaiah 8:20-22 describes the darkness that results from ignoring the Word. The people of Israel have been seeking truth by consulting mediums, deceived by Satan’s lie. Isaiah says, “To the teaching and to the testimony! If they will not speak according to this word, it is because they have no dawn. They will pass through the land, greatly distressed and hungry. And when they are hungry, they will be enraged and will speak contemptuously against their king and their God, and turn their faces upward. And they will look to the earth, but behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish. And they will be thrust into thick darkness.”

Darkness is a result of attempting to find truth without the Word of God. Sadly, as Isaiah says, when people do not have the “dawn,” they wander in darkness and often become angry at God, refusing to come to Him for help. This is why Satan’s masquerade as an angel of light is so effective. It turns white to black and black to white and gets us believing that God is the liar, that God is the source of darkness. Then, in our distress, we focus our hatred towards the only One who can save us.",0.9328,Positive,0.253269367448472,Neutral,0.4219173491001129,Positive

Ill tell you a secret for my kind! the Honorable nice!   We tend to have compassion for the takers who are our family.  Compassion due to Christ Consciousness. Adam and Eve bonded us but many chose and decided, didn't want to be your friend, your daughter, your etc.  If a parent, we are chasing them. it is hard when one is a parent and you love the child.   If having to chase, those have demons and do not know it. The demons are lies in their dark matter.  y they run, shout, scream, have a tantrum.  They never get any light and per demons hate the light.  If they liked the light they would not be afraid to tell the truth. We could meet our next boyfriend, girlfriend by no resolve with the one family member who use.  They dont know it but they are not protecting us by running.  Even the dad and hubby isn't protecting his wife every time, he gas lights and is bad!    the better wont and per their pain of being used.  We are the better and can designer our next life if Hell happens   Usually hell happens due to beliefs.   We want to get along with those but if they were the jealous child, they are in the bible!   They just come back bad, terrible or confused!  the kids who chose integrity always get stronger and see more. Evolution happened again and made some turn into savages and bad.  Many had great sex per Evolution. There is where erotic sex was in your bed!  it is due to Evolution.  Evolution also makes others want to live off the land.  The Homeless did but they faled at manners.   The selfish are lost per served father of lies in their unknowing.  They are lost.  They disrespect their Mothers at an early age.  That is due to their fathers that divide from an early age. if you, need to fix!  .   Some don't know but is partially planetary and most of the time we marry wrong.  We marry our parents.  We marry the dad that wasn't there. the dad that was a coward. The dad that could not deal with his guilt.  As soon as i decided to not babysit, I was free!",-0.9943,Negative,0.0660924723424723,Neutral,0.4371320307254791,Positive

"I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm being honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, hmm
Nobody cried
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say
""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you""
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why here
They don't deserve you
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Could've been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say
As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why here
They don't deserve you
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
