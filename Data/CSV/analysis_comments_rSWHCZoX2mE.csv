"We’re just KA’ers but we’re on fire
Smarter than Covid 19, faster than a murder bee
We’re living in a world, and it's on fire
Feeling the pressure, but we keep closing deals

Oh, we got both feet on the ground
And we’re burning it down
Oh, we get our work done in the cloud
And we’re not backing down
 
This team is on fire
This team is on fire
We’re reaching even higher
This team is on fire
 
Looks like the legal world now knows our name
So bright, Kerwin become a household word
Better look the other way
You can try but you'll never forget our name

We’re on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest attorneys say
Oh, we got both feet on the ground
And we’re burning it down
Oh, we get our work down in the cloud
And we’re not backing down
 
This team is on fire
This team is on fire
We’re reaching even higher
This team is on fire
 
Everybody stands, as we go by
‘Cause they can see the Candidates that we’ve supplied
Watch us when we’re lighting up the night
Everybody knows we’re owning our fight

And it's a crowded world
But we don' let clients burn, baby, burn, baby

This team is on fire
We’re reaching even higher
