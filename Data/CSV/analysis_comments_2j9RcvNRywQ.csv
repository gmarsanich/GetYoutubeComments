Jesus is my lord! And the solution to hell!

And dressing sexually/posing sexually is a sin but it's forgivable but just because a sin is forgivable doesn't mean you should commit it that's abusing Gods grace/forgiveness or it could be.

And show mercy to be shown mercy by God

Or it could be that you are just working for a private surveillance company and late at night you are told to report anomalies despite you not being trained for it.
