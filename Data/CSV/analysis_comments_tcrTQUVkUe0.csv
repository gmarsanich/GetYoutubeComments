"I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la-la-la
It felt like ooh, la-la-la
Yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
It felt like ooh, la-la-la, yeah
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say we're just friends
But friends don't know the way you taste, la-la-la
'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
Don't you let me fall, oh
Ooh, when your lips undress me
Hooked on your tongue
Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly
Don't stop
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la (true, la-la)
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
All along I've been coming for ya (for ya)
And I hope it meant something to ya (ooh)
Call my name, I'll be coming for ya
Coming for ya, coming for ya, coming for ya
For ya
For ya (oh, she loves it when I call)
For ya

"love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la-la-la
It felt like ooh, la-la-la
Yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
It felt like ooh, la-la-la, yeah
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say we're just friends
But friends don't know the way you taste, la-la-la
'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
Don't you let me fall, oh
Ooh, when your lips undress me
Hooked on your tongue
Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly
Don't stop
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la (true, la-la)
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
All along I've been coming for ya (for ya)
And I hope it meant something to ya (ooh)
Call my name, I'll be coming for ya
Coming for ya, coming for ya, coming for ya

"Hey y’all, i just want to tell y’all that Jesus Loves you <3. and we are all guilty sinners who have sinned against God. The bible says the wages of Sin is death. Sin is very dangerous and that is why we needed a Savior to save us from the wages (wages =what is due to someone) of sin. A righteous judge gives a person their 'wages' when they violate the law right? God is righteous and cannot let wrong doing (sin) go unpunished because he is 100% a perfect judge. Wages of sin is death means the wages of sin is Hell. Hell is an eternal place with fire and suffering. God doesn't want anybody to have to pay for their sins on their own because He Loves his creation so much that He sent His only Son Jesus Christ who is the way, the truth, and the life, to pay it for us.
2,000 years ago Jesus Christ gave himself up for us so that we can be forgiven of our sins committed against God and justified as a now righteous child of God in God's eyes because of what Jesus did❤️. Jesus is the only one who can save us from our sins.
Romans 6:23 ""For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.""Jesus Christ Christ is the only way to God, and The only one that we could find eternal life & Salvation through. 🌟 This Is The Truth. Whoever may be not sure of which way is the Truth, I Promise you will all of my heart & soul that Jesus Christ is the Truth. Any other way will lead someone to Eternal destruction (Hell) because they have called God a liar by denying Jesus Christ as the only way. 
Repent of your sins, turning from them and accept Gods free gift of eternal salvation to you. Come to Christ Jesus our Saviour 😜💘. Believe in who Jesus is, and Believe in everything he has done for you to be made right before God. 🍂🍂🍂 • Romans 10:9-10
“That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. 
 •Will You Accept Jesus Christ Today? 🛐❤️‍🩹(Just spreading the good news of Christ Jesus ) —(& you don’t have to accept Jesus Christ if you don’t want too :))",0.9808,Positive,0.1431055900621118,Neutral,0.3880676031112671,Positive
