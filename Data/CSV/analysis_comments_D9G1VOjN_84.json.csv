"I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready
Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall
And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us (huh)
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
Uh, look
Okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
P-P-Posted, being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em hasta luego
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic
Quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking
Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
Batter, batter up, who the baddest?
It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Pray it away, I swear
I'll never be a saint, no way
My enemy

"I love this song but is anyone else in love with all the little details with Powder and Jinx? Cause I am. 
Ekko scaring Powder at 0:47 is just really cute
The quick flash of Jinx at 1:50 when Powder mimics shooting the enforcerers
The way Powder’s scream at 2:46 syncs up with the beat drop 
It’s kinda hard to see but at 2:50 if you look closely, you can see Jinx lip sync to the ‘spare the sympathy’ right before her eyes glow
The part at 2:57 where Powder lip syncs along to ‘everybody wants to be my enemy’ 
3:03 The way Powder hits and crumbles against the wall where the projection is like she’s trying to fight against the person she’ll become 
Just the attention to detail at 3:13 when they animate Jinx’s shoulders dropping as all the enforcerers do. It’s such a tiny thing to animate that most people might not notice and they did it anyway. It’s just so good",0.8622,Positive,0.2533234126984127,Netural,0.4160262644290924,Positive

"I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready
Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall
And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us (huh)
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
Uh, look
Okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
P-P-Posted, being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em hasta luego
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic
Quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking
Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
Batter, batter up, who the baddest?
It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy

"I watched Arcane without having played Leage of Legends or anything like that and I can honestly say, out of all the shows I watced in 2021 - including other Netflix shows, K dramas, anime, and all different genres - Arcane was the best thing I watched all year. It was so unique, powerful and artistic - the visuals, music, and story combined to make an incredble experience. I am excited for however long I have to wait for the next season because it will be worth it.",0.933,Positive,0.2825757575757576,Netural,0.5186289548873901,Positive

"I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready
Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall
And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us (huh)
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
Uh, look
Okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
P-P-Posted, being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em hasta luego
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic
Quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking
Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
Batter, batter up, who the baddest?
It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy

(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready
Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall
And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us (huh)
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
Uh, look
Okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
P-P-Posted, being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em hasta luego
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic
Quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking
Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
Batter, batter up, who the baddest?
It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Pray it away, I swear
I'll never be a saint, no way
My enemy
Pray it away, I swear
I'll never be a saint",-0.9931,Negative,0.12500000000000003,Netural,-0.35841891169548035,Negative

"Man, I played LoL from 2013 to 2015 and promised to never tought it ever again and I guess you could imagine my surprise when, the same game that was mostly about titty chicks that moaned when you killed them+ very addictive gameplay, managed to make such an excellent adult series?? I must admit that I was expecting it to be very fanservice-y but it didn't even fall into that.

"(Cuídate a ti mismo)    
Me despierto con los sonidos
Del silencio que permite
Para que mi mente corra
Con mi oído hasta el suelo

Estoy buscando para contemplar
Las historias que se cuentan
Cuando estoy de espaldas al mundo
Que estaba sonriendo cuando me volví

Dile que eres el mejor
Pero una vez que te das la vuelta nos odian

ay la miseria
Todo el mundo quiere ser mi enemigo.
Ahórrate la simpatía
todo el mundo quiere ser
Mi enemigo-y-y-y-y
(Cuídate a ti mismo)
Mi enemigo(Mira)-y(Mira)-y(Mira)-y(Mira)-y
(Cuídate a ti mismo)
pero estoy listo

Tus palabras en la pared
Mientras rezas por mi caída
Y las risas en los pasillos
Y los nombres que me han llamado

Lo apilé en mi mente
Y estoy esperando el momento
Cuando te muestro cómo es
Para ser palabras escupir en un micrófono

Dile que eres el mejor
Pero una vez que te das la vuelta nos odian
(Eh)

ay la miseria
Todo el mundo quiere ser mi enemigo.
Ahórrate la simpatía
todo el mundo quiere ser
Mi enemigo(Mira)-y(Mira)-y(Mira)-y(Mira)-y
(Cuídate a ti mismo)
Mi enemigo(Mira)-y(Mira)-y(Mira)-y(Mira)-y
(Cuídate a ti mismo)

[JID:]
Uh, mira, está bien
Espero que alguien ore por mí
Estoy rezando para que alguien tenga esperanza por mí
Me quedo donde nadie se supone que debe estar
P-P-Publicado
Ser un naufragio de emociones
Listo para ir cuando quieras, solo avísame
El camino es largo, así que pon el pedal en el piso
El enemigo está en mi camino, mi energía no está disponible
Les digo hasta luego
Quieren trazar mi trote hasta la cima
he estado fuera de forma
Pensando fuera de la caja
soy un astronauta
Despegué de la roca del planeta
Para causar una catástrofe
Y importa más porque no lo tuve
¿Había pensado en causar estragos en una oposición?
Un poco impactante que querían estática
Con precisión, soy automático, mariscal de campo, no estoy hablando de despedir
Empácalo, empácalo, no me asuste
Batir, batir
¿Quién es el más malo?
No importa porque estamos en tu garganta

[Dan Reynolds:]
Todo el mundo quiere ser mi enemigo.
Ahórrate la simpatía
todo el mundo quiere ser
Mi enemigo
ay la miseria
Todo el mundo quiere ser mi enemigo.
Ahórrate la simpatía

"This MV may not be a trailer, but somehow it is a PERFECT built up for the show. Having watched the show multiple times, I want to come back and list some of the detail in the video for everyone who have watched the show to appreciate: 

0:04 The Last Drop - needless to say how important this place is in the show; 
0:16 First look of Imagine Dragons in the Arcane universe - and the fact that they actually made it into the show is absolutely amazing! 
0:20 Powder's monkey toy - those who have seen Jinx's champion trailer would know that this is somewhat of her brand. But for others, it's an introduction of the character and her favorite gadgetry. And this exact toy played a critical role in the show; 
0:37 The crying hug sets the tone. These sisters love each other, likely in a difficult condition;
0:39 Introduction of the ""squad"". For League players, this is where we found out there were Mylo and Clagger in addition to our familiar faces; 
0:45 Ekko also being part of the ""squad""; 
0:52, 1:32 Ekko and Powder playing together - unfortunately we don't have many scenes of their childhood in the show, but here you can see these two are clearly good friends. It makes sense as their are close in age. 
0:48 and 1:00 This restaurant is where the kids hang out at. They've ran away without paying for fun before - this is just (poor) kids being kids. It implied that the cook has seen these kids grow up. It explains why Vi went straight here for food AND information in episode 5. 
1:04 Four things in this sequence: 1. Vi will be one of the best fighters since she's teaching; 2. Kids in the Undercity stick together and have to learn to defend themselves; 3. When Ekko mentions in episode 1 that ""Vi showed me some moves to practice"", you will have this scene in mind; 4. First look on some of the characters that will end up on the other side of the conflict; 
1:22 I really can't get over how well they animated facial expressions... Just look at this sad smile! This is ""I love you"", ""I'm teaching you to protect yourself because I want you to be safe"" and ""I want you to have a better life"" all in two seconds; 
1:42 Enforcers clearly having a certain level of oppression over the Undercity people; 
1:57 From here we see the sisters start to have conflict. In this particular MV it seems that Powder is attracting unnecessary trouble. That's not the case in the show but it foreshadowed where the relationship is going between the sisters; 
2:21, 2:29, 2:31 and 2:39 These quick shots further portrayed Powder and Ekko's friendship. The wooden sword and the wok hat are what they used to play the game with, the very game they re-played in episode 7; 
2:47 Powder having mental breakdown; League players know that Jinx is kinda insane like Harley Quinn, but this implied that she had mental issue which lead to the final outcome; 
2:58 Powder being completely isolated with this particular line - implying that she will be left alone and not understood; 
3:08 The 3 looks of Powder in 3 different timeline; 
3:12 Jinx vs enforcers - they will all fall in her hands.

Uh, look
Okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me

Ready to go whenever, just let me know

The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable

They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic

"(Look out for yourself)
(Cuide de si mesmo)

I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
Eu acordo com os sons do silêncio que permitem

For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
Que a minha mente dê voltas, com meu ouvido colado no chão

I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
Estou procurando contemplar as histórias que são contadas

When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
Quando estou de costas para o mundo que estava sorrindo quando eu me virei


Tell you: You're the greatest
Te dizem: Você é o melhor

But once you turn, they hate us
Mas quando vira as costas, eles nos odeiam


Oh, the misery
Ah, que triste

Everybody wants to be my enemy
Todo mundo quer ser meu inimigo

Spare the sympathy
Poupe a simpatia

Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
Todo mundo quer ser meu inimigo-o-o-o-o

(Look out for yourself)
(Cuide de si mesmo)

My enemy-y-y-y-y
Meu inimigo-o-o-o-o

(Look out for yourself)
(Cuide de si mesmo)

But I'm ready
Mas estou pronto


Your words up on the wall as you'rе praying for my fall
Suas palavras na parede enquanto você reza pela minha queda

And the laughter in thе halls
E as risadas nos corredores

And the names that I've been called
E os nomes que já me chamaram

I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time
Eu os guardo comigo e espero pelo momento

When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
Em que vou te mostrar como é ser definido por palavras jogadas ao vento


Tell you: You're the greatest
Te dizem: Você é o melhor

But once you turn, they hate us
Mas quando vira as costas, eles nos odeiam


Oh, the misery
Ah, que triste

Everybody wants to be my enemy
Todo mundo quer ser meu inimigo

Spare the sympathy
Poupe a simpatia

Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
Todo mundo quer ser meu inimigo-o-o-o-o

(Look out for yourself)
(Cuide de si mesmo)

My enemy-y-y-y-y (yeah)
Meu inimigo-o-o-o-o (sim)

(Look out for yourself)
(Cuide de si mesmo)


Uh, look, okay
Unh, presta atenção, okay

I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
Estou torcendo que alguém reze por mim

I'm praying that somebody hope for me
Estou rezando por alguém que torça por mim

I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
Estou onde ninguém deveria estar

P-p-posted, being a wreck of emotions
P-p-parado aqui, uma confusão de emoções

Ready to go whenever just let me know
Pronto para ir para qualquer lugar, só me avisar

The road is long so put the pedal into the floor
A estrada é longa, então acelere bastante

The enemy's on my trail, my energy unavailable
O inimigo está nos seguindo, impossível ter minha energia

I'ma tell 'em: Hasta luego
Vou dizer para eles: Até mais

They wanna plot on my trot to the top
Eles querem sabotar minha corrida para o topo

I've been outta shape, thinking out the box I'm an astronaut
Tenho estado fora de forma, pensando fora da caixa, sou um astronauta

I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
Fui pra fora do planeta para causar uma catástrofe

And it matters more because I had it not
E importou porque eu não tinha nada

Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Eu pensei em causar destruições nos que se opuseram

Kinda shockin' they wanted a static with precision I'm automatic quaterback
Meio chocante que eles queriam um pau mandado com uma boa mira, sou um atacante dos bons

I ain't talking sacking, pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
Não estou falando besteira, bora, se prepara, eu não entro em pânico

Batter, batter up, who the baddest?
Bata, chame o próximo, quem é o chefe?

It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat
Não importa porque estamos aqui pra ganhar


Everybody wants to be my enemy
Todo mundo quer ser meu inimigo

Spare the sympathy
Poupe a simpatia

Everybody wants to be my enemy
Todo mundo quer ser meu inimigo

Oh, the misery
Ah, que triste

Everybody wants to be my enemy
Todo mundo quer ser meu inimigo

Spare the sympathy
Poupe a simpatia

Everybody wants to be my enemy
Todo mundo quer ser meu inimigo


Pray it away, I swear
Reze para que acabe logo, eu juro

I'll never be a saint, no way
Nunca serei um santo, sem chance

My enemy
Meu inimigo

Pray it away, I swear
Reze para que acabe logo, eu juro

I'll never be a saint
Nunca serei um santo
