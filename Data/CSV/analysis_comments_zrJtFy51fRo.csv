"This message to all the humans , don't follow the religion of your parents ,You must work your mind to reach to the right religion because after your death you will be judged alone, and the message is, You must read the holy Quran, the holy book of islam religion.. Read the holy Quran don't hear about islam.. And this is some verses of it..In the name of allah,The Entirely merciful, the Especially merciful.^^   Say ""He is allah, (who is) one, Allah the eternal refuge,He neither begets nor is born. Nor is there to Him any equivalent^^.... ^^And whoever desires other than islam as religion - never will it be accepted from Him and He, in the hereafter, will be among the losers^^... And this book is the last and final revelation from allah.. And this book had revealed from 1400 years.. And this book is so matches with the science... I will show you just one proof matches the science..“..
Hypoxia  
Lack of oxygen.
At high altitude the oxygen concentration in the atmosphere decreases. When oxygen level drops the blood vessels in the lungs constrict:
Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), also known as the Euler-Liljestrand mechanism, is a physiological phenomenon in which small pulmonary arteries constrict in the presence of alveolar hypoxia (low oxygen levels). 
Wikipedia, Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction, 2019
The blood vessels in the lungs constrict when oxygen level drops. This was only known recently however this was portrayed in the Quran 1400 years before it was discovered.
[Quran 6.125] Those whom Allah wants to guide, He opens their chests to Islam; And those whom He wants to leave astray, He makes their chests tight and constricted, as if they are ascending to the sky: Such is the penalty of Allah on those who refuse to believe.
""He makes their chests tight and constricted, as if they are ascending to the sky"" today we know why it gets constricted, lack of oxygen. No mistakes in the Quran.
How could an illiterate man who lived 1400 years ago have known what gets constricted at high altitude?.. .and if you want hundreds of mircles enter here:  http://www.miracles-of-quran.com/                  The message is ended.. This message is to not say after your death i don't know the islam religion and i had followed the religion of my parents without thinking .and you should believe that Abraham, moses, jesus, mohammed and all the prophets are messengers of allah . O God i have delivered (the message), may you be my witness.
Enter here to read The quran .https://sunniconnect.com/m3/download/pdf-al-quran-saheeh-international-translation/
Enter here to know that The quran is the words of allah. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRMTb1q1lrk&feature=share.) 
#islam is the religion of peace
#spread this message
One God
One life
One chance
#there is no God but Allah, mohammed is god's massenger. ☝️

"1. Recognize Your Condition

The Ten Commandments prove we have broken God's Law.

Exodus 20 ""Thou shalt not bear false witness (lie).""  Thou shalt not steal."" Thou shalt not commit adultery.""  ""Thou shalt not covet.""  ""Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in Vain."" The truth is, if God judged you by the Ten Commandments, God would find you guilty.  Romans 3:19: ""...that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.""  Romans 3:23:  ""For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.""
2. Realize the Price of Sin Is Death And Hell.

Romans 6:23: ""For the wages of sin is death...""  Revelation 20:15 ""And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.""  Hell is a real place, where those who choose to pay for their own sin will go for all eternity.

3. Realize Jesus Paid Your Sin Debt.

Romans 5:6-8: ""For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.""  Jesus, the Son of God, suffered and died on the cross for your sins.  John 3:16: ""For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.""  Jesus loves you. He wants you to be saved and live in Heaven with Him for all eternity.

4. Receive Jesus Christ As Your Saviour.

John 1:12: ""But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.""  In faith, trust Jesus as your Saviour today.  Acts 16:30-31: ""...Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved...""  John 5:24: ""Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.""

Would You Like To Know That Heaven Will Be Your Home?

Do you admit that you are a sinner?

Do you understand that Hell is the penalty for your sin?

Do you believe that Jesus died to pay for your sin?

Will you ask Jesus to save you today?

Since August 26, 2017 I have remained discreet because I wanted to resolve this issue without anyone knowing. This post is not for fame or anything like that, but definitely for the truth to come out and clarify things.
Billboard published the first news about the lawsuit that I, Newton Canga (My Partner) filed against Luis Fonsi, Erika Ender and Daddy Yankee for having used my DESPACITO composition without my authorization and having made changes to my lyrics to hide plagiarism. The corruption in this dirty business covers the truth with money, and due to little resources, I had to litigate this case without a lawyer. I had to let all the impostors involved in this case know where the story of this expression came from.
To the court I presented the registration of the song Despacito, which was registered in 2006 with the library of Congress. I presented my DIARY ... one of my notebooks from 2009 where I wrote about the people who wanted to arrange my song and who are connected with Luis Fonsi, Erika Ender and Zuleyka Rivera, the female lead of the music video. In addition, I submitted photographs and specific dates that show how these impostors had access to my work. Few of you will enter the judicial page (PACER), and read the motions full of arguments explaining what happened, but here I leave the case number (1: 19-cv-22813) for those who want to investigate further.
The non-Spanish speaking judge wrongly implied that I am litigating this case because of the title of both songs. I must emphasize that although the titles and other elements are not protected by the copyright law, it is a lot of coincidence that both works have this amount of similarities that you will see below.
1] The same title and theme [2] Root of the same genre (Rap - Reguetton / Pop - Reguetton) [3] Vulgar words are not used in both lyrics [4] The word Despacito is used almost in the same amount: ( Plaintiff = Nine, Defendants = Ten) [5] The total number of words used is roughly the same (Plaintiff = 457, Defendants = 453) [6] SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS GROUPED IN THE CHORUS AREA AND SIMLAR MODIFICATIONS IN THE LAST CHORUS OF BOTH SONGS [7] Too many similar expressions scattered in the stanzas [8] The length of both songs in MP3 format is approximately the same (Plaintiff = 3:50, Defendants = 3:48 [9] Expressions written by me (plaintiff), which They were not said by the defendants, but they were shown in the music video that already has 6.9 Billion views.
Consequently, if the court had analyzed in detail both compositions as a whole, it would have identified the existence of a real problem for the trial. The judge on August 11, 2020 closed the case arguing that ""the works are only similar in terms of unprotected elements and do not share any similarity in the level of protectable expression."" She never argued about the 17 USC 101 code which clearly explains how my chorus area is protected by copyright law by me pointing out the same choice of words grouped in the defendant's chorus.
The words used in my chorus and the defendant's chorus are naturally not supposed to flow into a ""specific area"", in this case the heart of both songs (the chorus). Title 17 of the United States Code, section 101, explains that ""copyright may protect an author's original contribution to a compilation of unprotected elements,"" specifically, the original way in which the author has selected, coordinated and ordered the elements of his work. ""
In other words; ""The defendants are free to use the same elements in the public domain, as long as they are not selected and ordered in the same way."" (Now I ask !!); After I used my love letters and elements from my other 2 songs to complete the full expression of my song Despacito, how is it possible that 3 composers (Defendants) have concluded with elements similar to mine in the chorus area? When a LOT OF ELEMENTS are seen in the same area of 2 compositions, and those words, however brief, create the same situation, this cannot be considered a coincidence, especially when there is evidence that clearly shows with dates and photos how the accused had access to my composition.
I used approximately 457 words and the defendant 453. How is it possible that only in the CHORUS, which is the heart of both compositions, Luis Fonsi, Erika Ender and Daddy Yankee have placed the same words that I select to give life to my choir? ? The 17 USC 101 code protects my expression regardless of how common the words I group and select to build my chorus area. Luis Fonsi himself admitted that Despacito is a song that he felt he had heard before. Look on youtube >>> How I wrote that Song: Luis Fonsi ""Despacito"" https://youtu.be/E6W-7trFIsI
It is common practice that arranger pirates never copy a song word for word. The 12 elements that are in the zone of both chorus and that are forming the same scene, should have been enough to demonstrate plagiarism in this case. There was no song that the court or the defendants could track down, and that the chorus area will use the amount of elements that I and the defendants are using in the chorus. Case closed can be opened, but if the court had been more diligent and considered my proof of access and then scrutinized the chorus of both compositions, the case would not have been closed.",0.9882,Positive,-0.01780679933665,Negative,-0.5368401408195496,Negative

"This song always cheers me up! 
Luis Fonsi is a great artist and it is not surprising that his song became the World’s number one hit. 
Despacito's success inspired me to explore more deeply about him. 
I found out that behind this success is twenty years of hard work and in his honor I made a video about him and his career which you can watch on my channel. 
Enjoy, Fonsi is the best!",0.983,Positive,0.2258333333333333,Positive,0.8489820957183838,Positive
