Why am I always hit on by the boys I never like
I can always see 'em coming, from the left or from the right
I don't want to be a priss, I'm just try'na be polite
But it always seems to bite me in the
Ask me for my number, yeah, you put me on the spot
You think that we should hook up, but I think that we should not
You had me at ""hello"", then you opened up your mouth
And that is when it started going south
Oh!
Get your hands off my hips, 'fore I'll punch you in the lips
Stop your staring at my hey!
Take a hint, take a hint
No you can't buy me a drink, let me tell you what I think
I think you could use a mint
Take a hint, take a hint
T-take a hint, take a hint
I guess you still don't get it, so let's take it from the top
You asked me what my sign is, and I told you it was ""stop""
And if I had a dime for every name that you just dropped
You'd be here and I'd be on a yacht
Oh!
Get your hands off my hips, 'fore I'll punch you in the lips
Stop your staring at my hey!
Take a hint, take a hint
No you can't buy me a drink, let me tell you what I think
I think you could use a mint
Take a hint, take a hint
T-take a hint, take a hint
What about ""no"" don't you get?
So go and tell your friends
I'm not really interested
It's about time that you're leavin'
I'm gonna count to three and
Open my eyes and
You'll be gone
One
Get your hands off my
Two
Or I'll punch you in the
Three
Stop your staring at my hey!
Take a hint, take a hint
I am not your missing link
Let me tell you what I think
I think you could use a mint

"An astonishing number of undifferentiated girls are out there who thinks that all boys sucks. Look ladies, some boys are like that, I'm not going to lie. But you can't say all of them are idiots. This is like an uncritical, stigmatising view towards an entire gender. In the same way, you can't view members of a particular nationality or culture as the same. These are questionable stereotypes. Dont act silly. 
You can't generally say that guys are childish, too convinced of themselves or simply idiots. Many are really nice persons without any bad intentions. So would you stop hating half the world and can we just appreciate the song please?

La La la la la la la 
La la la la la la la

Why am I always hit on by the boys I never like
(私ってどうしていつもタイプじゃない男に好かれるんだろう？)
I can always see 'em coming, from the left or from the right
(右から左からそんなのばっか寄ってくるのよね。)
I don't want to be a priss, I'm just try'na be polite
(気取ってるつもりはないわ、自分に素直なだけ。)
But it always seems to bite me in the…
(でもそれじゃあうまくいかないみたいなのよね…)

Ask me for my number, yeah, you put me on the spot
(番号だけ聞いたらすぐどっか行っちゃうんでしょ？)
You think that we should hook-up, but I think that we should not
(それで私たちを射止めたつもりでしょうけど、私たち全然そんな風に思ってないから。)
You had me at hello, then you opened up your mouth
(ハローって呼び止めて口説こうとしてたでしょ？)
And that is when it started going south 
(その時から私たち、あなた達に興味無かったの。)

Oh!
Get your hands off my hips, 
(気安く体に触らないで。)
'fore I'll punch you in the lips
(顔面にパンチするわよ。)
Stop your staring at my
(見つめてんじゃないわよ。)
Hey! 
Take a hint, take a hint!
(気付きなさいよ。)
No you can't buy me a drink, 
(おごってくれなくていい。)
let me tell you what I think
(はっきり言うわね。)
I think you could use a mint 
(出直して来たらいいわ。)

Take a hint, take a hint!
(気付きなさいよ。)
T-take a hint, take a hint!
(いい加減気付きなさいよ。)

I guess you still don't get it, so let's take it from the top
(まだわかってないみたいね、じゃあ教えてあげる。)
You asked me what my sign is, and I told you it was Stop
(「俺たちイケてる？」って聞くから、「ありえない」って答えたわよね。)
And if I had a dime for every name that you just dropped
(あなたをフった娘の数だけ10セント硬貨があったら、)
You'd be here and I'd be on a yacht
(余裕でヨットが買えるでしょうね。)

Oh!
Get your hands off my hips, 
(触らないでって言ったでしょ。)
'fore I'll punch you in the lips
(パンチされたいの？)
Stop your staring at my
(見つめてんじゃないわよ。)
Hey! 
Take a hint, take a hint!
(気付きなさいよ。)
No you can't buy me a drink, 
(おごってくれなんて言った？)
let me tell you what I think
(はっきり言わなきゃわからないの？)
I think you could use a mint 
(二度と近寄らないでよね。)

Take a hint, take a hint!
(気付きなさいよ。)
T-take a hint, take a hint!
(いい加減気付きなさいよ。)

What about ""no"" don't you get 
(返事は「ノー」なの。)
So go and tell your friends
(お友達にも教えてあげて。)
I'm not really interested
(全然興味なんて無いんだって。)
It's about time that you're leavin'
(そろそろどっか行ってくれない？)
I'm gonna count to three and
(3つ数えてあげるからさ、)
Open my eyes and You'll be gone…
(目を開けたら消えててよね…)

One…Get your hands off my…
(1…触らないで…)
Two…Or I'll punch you in the….
(2…殴られたいの？)
Three…Stop your staring at my
(3…見つめないでって言ってるの。)

Hey!
Take a hint, take a hint‼︎
(気付きなさいよ！)

I am not your missing link
(運命なんて感じてないわ。)
Let me tell you what I think
(はっきり言ってあげるわね。)
I think you could use a mint
(二度と顔見せないでよね。)
Take a hint, take a hint…
(気付きなさいよ。)
Take a hint, take a hint
(いい加減にして。)

Woah!

Get your hands off my hips,

"Why am I always hit on by the boys I never like
I can always see 'em coming, from the left or from the right
I don't want to be a priss, I'm just try'na be polite
But it always seems to bite me in the
Ask me for my number, yeah, you put me on the spot
You think that we should hook up, but I think that we should not
You had me at ""hello"", then you opened up your mouth
And that is when it started going south
Oh!
Get your hands off my hips, 'fore I'll punch you in the lips
Stop your staring at my hey!
Take a hint, take a hint
No you can't buy me a drink, let me tell you what I think
I think you could use a mint
Take a hint, take a hint
T-take a hint, take a hint
I guess you still don't get it, so let's take it from the top
You asked me what my sign is, and I told you it was ""stop""
And if I had a dime for every name that you just dropped
You'd be here and I'd be on a yacht
Oh!
Get your hands off my hips, 'fore I'll punch you in the lips
Stop your staring at my hey!
Take a hint, take a hint
No you can't buy me a drink, let me tell you what I think
I think you could use a mint
Take a hint, take a hint
T-take a hint, take a hint
What about ""no"" don't you get?
So go and tell your friends
I'm not really interested
It's about time that you're leavin'
I'm gonna count to three and
Open my eyes and
You'll be gone
One
Get your hands off my
Two
Or I'll punch you in the
Three
Stop your staring at my hey!
Take a hint, take a hint
I am not your missing link
Let me tell you what I think
I think you could use a mint
Take a hint, take a hint
Take a hint, take a hint
Woah!
Get your hands off my hips, 'fore I'll punch you in the lips
Stop your staring at my hey!
Take a hint, take a hint
