"I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That’s that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Bad-ass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that’s it)
ジョージアでピーチを手に入れて
マリファナはカリフォルニアから仕入れている
女は北へ連れてってやった（ビッチ）
光源から光を正しく受けて
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
And I see you (Ohh)
The way I breathe you in (In)
It’s the texture of your skin
I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby
Never let you go, oh
And I say, oh
There’s nothing like your touch
It’s the way you lift me up
Yeah, and I’ll be right here with you ‘til the end of time
そしてお前を見ている
息づかいを感じながら
肌の質感を感じて
抱きしめたいよベイビー
決してお前を離さない、ああ
そして俺は言う
お前のタッチに勝るものはないのさ
俺を持ち上げる方法なのさ
そして最後までお前と一緒いるよ
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That’s that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Bad-ass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that’s it)
ジョージアでピーチを手に入れて
マリファナはカリフォルニアから仕入れている
女は北へ連れてってやった（ビッチ）
光源から光を正しく受けて
[Verse 2: Daniel Caesar]
You ain’t sure yet, but I’m for ya
All I could want, all I could wish for
Nights alone that we miss more
And days we save as souvenirs
There’s no time, I wanna make more time
And give you my whole life
I left my girl, I’m in my Yorker
Hate to leave her, call it torture
Remember when I couldn’t hold her
Left the baggage for a mover
確信はないだろうが俺はお前のためにある
欲しいものはすべて　願うことはすべて
一人の夜はもっと恋しくなる
そして　お土産として取っておく日々
時間がないもっと時間を作りたい
お前に俺の人生の全てを捧げるよ
女を残し、俺はヨーカーにいる
あいつと別れるのは嫌だ　拷問とでも言うべきだろうか
あいつを抱いていられなかったことを覚えている
引っ越し屋に荷物を預けて

I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That’s that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Bad-ass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that’s it)
ジョージアでピーチを手に入れて
マリファナはカリフォルニアから仕入れている
女は北へ連れてってやった（ビッチ）
光源から光を正しく受けて
[Verse 3: GIVEON]
I get the feeling, so I’m sure (Sure)
Hand in my hand because I’m yours (I can’t)
I can’t pretend, I can’t ignore, you’re right for me
Don’t think you wanna know just where I’ve been, ohh
Done bein’ distracted
The one I need is right in my arms (Oh)
Your kisses taste the sweetest with mine
And I’ll be right here with you ‘til the end of time
気持ちが伝わってくるから　きっと
俺はお前のものさ　手を握ってくれ
知らないふりをすることも　無視することもできない　お前は俺にぴったりなのさ
お前は俺がどこにいたか知りたいとは思わないだろう
気が散ってしょうがない
お前が必要としている人は、俺の腕の中にいる
お前とのキスは俺と一緒にいると一番甘い味がする
お前とのキスは俺のキスよりも甘い味がする そして俺は時間の終わりまでお前と一緒にここにいる
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That’s that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Bad-ass bitch)

"I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (that's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)
And I see you (oh), the way I breathe you in (in), it's the texture of your skin
I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby, never let you go, oh
And I say, oh, there's nothing like your touch
It's the way you lift me up, yeah
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end
I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (that's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)
You ain't sure yet, but I'm for ya
All I could want, all I can wish for
Nights alone that we miss more
And days we save as souvenirs
There's no time, I wanna make more time
And give you my whole life
I left my girl, I'm in Mallorca
Hate to leave her, call it torture
Remember when I couldn't hold her
Left her baggage for Rimowa
I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (that's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)
I get the feeling, so I'm sure (sure)
Hand in my hand because I'm yours
I can't, I can't pretend, I can't ignore you're right for me
Don't think you wanna know just where I've been, oh
Done being distracted
The one I need is right in my arms (oh)
Your kisses taste the sweetest with mine
And I'll be right here with you 'til end of time
I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (that's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)
I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (that's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (badass bitch)

I get my weed from California (that's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)

And I see you (oh), the way I breathe you in (in), it's the texture of your skin
I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby, never let you go, oh
And I say, oh, there's nothing like your touch
It's the way you lift me up, yeah
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end
I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (that's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)
You ain't sure yet, but I'm for ya
All I could want, all I can wish for
Nights alone that we miss more
And days we save as souvenirs
There's no time, I wanna make more time
And give you my whole life
I left my girl, I'm in Mallorca
Hate to leave her, call it torture
Remember when I couldn't hold her
Left her baggage for Rimowa

I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (that's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)
I get the feeling, so I'm sure (sure)
Hand in my hand because I'm yours
I can't, I can't pretend, I can't ignore you're right for me
Don't think you wanna know just where I've been, oh
Done being distracted
The one I need is right in my arms (oh)
Your kisses taste the sweetest with mine
And I'll be right here with you 'til end of time

I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (that's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)

And I see you (oh), the way I breathe you in (in), it's the texture of your skin
I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby, never let you go, oh
And I say, oh, there's nothing like your touch
It's the way you lift me up, yeah

All I could want, all I can wish for
Nights alone that we miss more
And days we save as souvenirs
There's no time, I wanna make more time

Hate to leave her, call it torture

I get the feeling, so I'm sure (sure)
Hand in my hand because I'm yours
I can't, I can't pretend, I can't ignore you're right for me
Don't think you wanna know just where I've been, oh
Done being distracted
The one I need is right in my arms (oh)
Your kisses taste the sweetest with mine
