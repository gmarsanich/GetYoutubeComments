"This is the funniest song lyric and fits like a glove or like ass on bucket to my life drama. But right now I'm having a laughing fit of a lifetime because it feels like ""The Liberation"" It's my liberation blow. Because what was once suffering feels like a feather. Yes, light is coming. I don't need anyone anymore. I am free and now I can finally love. Thank you Freddie I bow to your masterpiece and thank you for the fitting words of one of my most difficult processes. You are such a pure soul, it's a pity you are no longer with us.

"I never paid too much attention to the rock band Queen. So liked their songs but that's it. Then on biography I watched a documentary of Queen. I have since viewed every documentary I can get a hold of. I am in love with Freddy Mercury. Everything about him but mostly his fear of death and his worry over what we, his fans would think once we found out he was dying and what was killing him....wait for it....Freddy chose to tell us his big ugly secret 24 hours before his last breath and faced death head on by not taking an easier way. John Wayne explains courage as ""being scared as hell but saddling up anyway. Freddy to me has touched the hearts and minds of all walks.  Making his big ugly secret his big beautiful gift to us whom he loved so much. Please watch the last song he did on video. It is his message to us.

Oh, Lord
Ooh somebody, ooh somebody
