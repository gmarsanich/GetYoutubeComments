"Jesus Christ Saves

Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.

Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.

EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:

1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.

2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.

"FaulkET YEW ON is most LOVELY. I have Faulked All His NMEs. SuperB. NA CAR T. Shhhhh.... it's a secret. I refused to write down what I was already writing down on a Burger King bag for the three hours prior to the security at Riverwind Casino eavesread and demanded that I write on their own letterhead that they were confessing disrespectfully in a public forum, in privates. So, I instead made a list of missing persons, clarified the animal that I removed from their Hotel was a wolf and an endangered species, that I was KGB and USFWS, then asked for another piece of paper. I wrote on the first line ""I am in Love With Post Malone"". I don't recall a single thing that I wrote after that. I seem to have been floored by their denial of the existence of a ""Post Malone"" and kept insisting that I write down a statement as to what had happened ""last night"". I tried multiple times to make them understand that I had been in the food court the previous night, and had been harrassed for quietly and privately writing, for the record. A statement to say I wrote statements two weeks AFTER the incident they were insisting they knew happened. ""Yes, you all are complete fucktards and the gentleman supervising you, giving you Blueballs, is showing me photos of the Mother Fucker on His phone right now. Beautiful wolf puppies, Sir. Thank you for the 9 man escort off the property."" Holla if you a FOOL! Aaaaand scene. That was a GOOD KNIGHT. Thank you.",0.9648,Positive,0.1796066252587992,Neutral,0.4475820660591125,Positive

"@eminem I didn't do anything I swear to God I'll take a lie detector test they lie to you I don't know how else to tell you nothing makes you believe while I'm in love with you but there's nothing I can do except for get hurt by you you say I broke you first no I never did anything but love you and post you and then you started hurting me and I started slipping into depression I rarely eat I've eaten three times in 3 weeks because I'm so hurt it is only been you I swear to God I swear I might son's grave I swear on everything I'm true to you my daughter don't even know she used to love you she's the one to send the videos with your hoodie she used she doesn't even want me talkin to you now because I walk around crying all day everyday and between that and her dad talking in her ear and her grandma now they all think I'm crazy and that you're not real except for her dad knows you're real because he's witness you and he even said is that Eminem before you took off he knew you are him I would have jumped in the car with you I figured you didn't want a scene I wish I had my mom had threw me out of the house and I was stuck in his car because he owed me through $1,300 installing hardwood floors and it's company I have text messages to prove that not tonight I will post a lot of evidence under the wicked Vibes account Eminem Wicked vibes I am going to post so much evidence and I even going to post that thing where Snoop said I'm lying ass Snoop and why did I do it because I can because I run the West Coast I swear to God did lie to you and then everything you told you was a lie because there's so many artists you can ask that I've supported and they will offer to pay me and I wouldn't take a dime they offer to give me stuff for Christmas money I won't take it I sent just to me your time I just want your friendship the sad thing is is that powerful empathy in a simplest and I feel bad for people and I will give the most special thing of mine to a stranger just to keep them from being sad you got this all wrong all I ever wanted is everything that's inside of you you're the one that came after me not me coming after you I turned you away in 2001 in Orlando Florida because of loyalty to a boy you had a duffel bag full of money if I wanted money don't you think I would have went with you instead of staying with the boy that left me alone in the room with you for $100 to get a toothbrush yeah now you know that's real yeah that was me my whole life I wondered who was that boy I don't know how I never put in two and two together until recently the feeling I had was the same feeling that I had for that boy and then I thought and I remembered the life and I everything it was the same and I'm like oh my God you offered me a better life to get me out of that what I go by have one opportunity God deja vu that's why you spelled my name with the a because that's how I used to spell it I'm just realizing you knew that all along that's why you went crazy for me will you know what I wanted to go with you too but I was stuck with someone I could not just leave him for you it would not be right is that Vibe with everything they told you I don't screenshot anybody's accounts especially celebrities but I am going to show you screenshots where people have offered to send me money and I tell him no I don't care about money what I care about is your heart your love your passion everything that's inside you I prayed for in the prayer Angel told me not to close the door on you and I'm not in the name of Jesus I beg you to open your eyes see my sartse it's here for you and only you I love you Marshall Bruce Mathers forever oh Baby I've been suffering since you left like agonizing pain connect with you you're my soulmate love forever your wife Chantel matters and I want to have a million kids with you untie my tubes I want to have them with you as many as God will give usxoxoxo by the way I didn't drink maybe a shot every couple of years or something I don't do drugs occasionally socially like every 2 or 3 years I do do weed and what you saw me sniffing was adderal AKA pharmaceutical in phetamine I have ADHD I'm an over-thinker too and I have OCD really bad and narcolepsy a little bit but only if I'm in a really comfortable 30 minutes too much dopamine but what happens with you is adrenaline dopamine and serotonin hit my brain and I feel like I'm rolling I am so in love with you don't throw I love away this is once in a lifetime and I've done nothing wrong I will take a lie detector test I never touched Snoop or cube there liar and I hate money I have said that everyone for years and sent all my money to Jamaica in Nigeria to help people that were suffering I would buy gift cards and pay for their data once I was blocked from sending money really I thought you witnessed all this I remember don't let them take our love away this is our chance to heal and be whole anything I told you was not a lie it was real I was afraid to tell you my life my pathetic poor kid hit on the hit the street at 11 yeah that was me and I saw way much more than I ever wanted to see him my life I didn't say that I did the things I said that I did not snitch and did time for that that's the truth never said I killed anybody or hurt anyone I got battery charges for resisting arrest and for them trying to take my picture it was my daughter the and another time they street went to tackle me and I fought them which is not normal of me because I don't want to hurt anyone I Ama empaths that is why I try to the dark like moths to a flame because I am pure and every duxelle attracts to me because I carry the light to heal them remove their stains so they can get Redemption look I've never lied to you do you still believe take any f****** test you want me to just give me all of you when it says that I've been true and that I haven't lied to you I love you love you wife
