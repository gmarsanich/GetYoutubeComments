"Got a horse in the back and a goat in the front
And I'm pourin' out yak while I'm smokin' a blunt
And a trap and cowboy hat and a pump
'Cause I ain't going out like a rat or a punk
Don't be silly man I really gotta kill him
When I'm loadin' up the semi hit him in the cerebellum
I was raised on the farm and the city full of felons
Keeps a knife on deck like I'm trimmin' down a hedges

[Verse 2]
Ciggy hangin' out my mouth, I got Carharrt on my jacket
I was raised down in the south eatin' moose meat and catfish
Everything I eat I caught, flannel undies like a boss
I just watered all my crops, load my truck I'm takin' off
We're ridin' down that dirt road on that Sunday night
With the windows rolled down on the country side
Saw a reflection in the mirror and I thought oh my-my

"I'm just tryna have a good time
Cigarette butts and moonshine
I'm goin' redneck tonight
I got my horse by my side
Full tank of gas in my ride
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Take a look at what the industry did to me
I was drinkin' Hennessy and then I had an epiphany
Got me thinkin' I should kill 'em, and I'm sayin' it literally
Middle fingers to my enemies, I don't give 'em this energy
Got a horse in the back and a goat in the front
And I'm pourin' out yak while I'm smokin' a blunt
And a trap and cowboy hat and a pump
'Cause I ain't going out like a rat or a punk
Don't be silly man I really gotta kill him
When I'm loadin' up the semi hit him in the cerebellum
I was raised on the farm and the city full of felons
Keeps a knife on deck like I'm trimmin' down a hedges

[Verse 2]
Ciggy hangin' out my mouth, I got Carharrt on my jacket
I was raised down in the south eatin' moose meat and catfish
Everything I eat I caught, flannel undies like a boss
I just watered all my crops, load my truck I'm takin' off
We're ridin' down that dirt road on that Sunday night
With the windows rolled down on the country side
Saw a reflection in the mirror and I thought oh my-my
I said, ""Ooh pretty girl you make me feel alright!""
Catch me drinkin' out of the keg with my chickens hatchin' eggs
You would think I'd act my age but I'm pissed like everyday
You can call me white trash but I don't give a fuck
Someone pass the Zig Zag's and let's get lifted like my truck

[Verse 3]
'Bout to turn my backyard into a shootin' range
Who's to blame? Headshot, I got stupid aim
I won't stop 'til a motherfuckin' rooster sing
I sold my Ford to put a Hemi in my new Mustang (Yah!)
I'm the real Garth Brooks of this rap shit
So Billy Ray Cyrus if he want it he can have it
I've got Hannah Montana at my ranch gettin' hammered
I'm a savage catch me hackin' up wood doin' damage
I'm just sayin' I ain't goin' out like that
Got a feather behind my ear beneath my cowboy hat
Got a years worth of deer, you can count on that
Like a steakhouse, I'm out back

[Chorus]
Let's have a good time
Cigarette butts and moonshine
I'm goin' redneck tonight
I got my horse by my side
Full tank of gas in my ride

I'm just tryna have a good time
Cigarette butts and moonshine
I'm goin' redneck tonight
I got my horse by my side
Full tank of gas in my ride

"[Chorus]
I'm just tryna have a good time
Cigarette butts and moonshine
I'm goin' redneck tonight
I got my horse by my side
Full tank of gas in my ride
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Take a look at what the industry did to me
I was drinkin' Hennessy and then I had an epiphany
Got me thinkin' I should kill 'em, and I'm sayin' it literally
Middle fingers to my enemies, I don't give 'em this energy
Got a horse in the back and a goat in the front
And I'm pourin' out yak while I'm smokin' a blunt
And a trap and cowboy hat and a pump
'Cause I ain't going out like a rat or a punk
Don't be silly man I really gotta kill him
When I'm loadin' up the semi hit him in the cerebellum
I was raised on the farm and the city full of felons
Keeps a knife on deck like I'm trimmin' down a hedges

[Verse 2]
Ciggy hangin' out my mouth, I got Carharrt on my jacket
I was raised down in the south eatin' moose meat and catfish
Everything I eat I caught, flannel undies like a boss
I just watered all my crops, load my truck I'm takin' off
We're ridin' down that dirt road on that Sunday night
With the windows rolled down on the country side
Saw a reflection in the mirror and I thought oh my-my
I said, ""Ooh pretty girl you make me feel alright!""
Catch me drinkin' out of the keg with my chickens hatchin' eggs
You would think I'd act my age but I'm pissed like everyday
You can call me white trash but I don't give a fuck
Someone pass the Zig Zag's and let's get lifted like my truck

[Verse 3]
'Bout to turn my backyard into a shootin' range
Who's to blame? Headshot, I got stupid aim
I won't stop 'til a motherfuckin' rooster sing
I sold my Ford to put a Hemi in my new Mustang (Yah!)
I'm the real Garth Brooks of this rap shit
So Billy Ray Cyrus if he want it he can have it
I've got Hannah Montana at my ranch gettin' hammered
I'm a savage catch me hackin' up wood doin' damage
I'm just sayin' I ain't goin' out like that
Got a feather behind my ear beneath my cowboy hat
Got a years worth of deer, you can count on that
Like a steakhouse, I'm out back

[Chorus]
Let's have a good time
Cigarette butts and moonshine
I'm goin' redneck tonight
I got my horse by my side
Full tank of gas in my ride

I'm just tryna have a good time
Cigarette butts and moonshine
I'm goin' redneck tonight
I got my horse by my side
Full tank of gas in my ride

Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more

You can go and ask her
My life is a movie
Bull ridin' and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rock star
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more",0.9929,Positive,-0.0690867003367003,Negative,-0.4459359049797058,Negative

"Chorus]
I'm just tryna have a good time
Cigarette butts and moonshine
I'm goin' redneck tonight
I got my horse by my side
Full tank of gas in my ride
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Take a look at what the industry did to me
I was drinkin' Hennessy and then I had an epiphany
Got me thinkin' I should kill 'em, and I'm sayin' it literally
Middle fingers to my enemies, I don't give 'em this energy
Got a horse in the back and a goat in the front
And I'm pourin' out yak while I'm smokin' a blunt
And a trap and cowboy hat and a pump
'Cause I ain't going out like a rat or a punk
Don't be silly man I really gotta kill him
When I'm loadin' up the semi hit him in the cerebellum
I was raised on the farm and the city full of felons
Keeps a knife on deck like I'm trimmin' down a hedges

[Verse 2]
Ciggy hangin' out my mouth, I got Carharrt on my jacket
I was raised down in the south eatin' moose meat and catfish
Everything I eat I caught, flannel undies like a boss
I just watered all my crops, load my truck I'm takin' off
We're ridin' down that dirt road on that Sunday night
With the windows rolled down on the country side
Saw a reflection in the mirror and I thought oh my-my
I said, ""Ooh pretty girl you make me feel alright!""
Catch me drinkin' out of the keg with my chickens hatchin' eggs
You would think I'd act my age but I'm pissed like everyday
You can call me white trash but I don't give a fuck
Someone pass the Zig Zag's and let's get lifted like my truck 

[Verse 3]
'Bout to turn my backyard into a shootin' range
Who's to blame? Headshot, I got stupid aim
I won't stop 'til a motherfuckin' rooster sing
I sold my Ford to put a Hemi in my new Mustang (Yah!)
I'm the real Garth Brooks of this rap shit
So Billy Ray Cyrus if he want it he can have it
I've got Hannah Montana at my ranch gettin' hammered
I'm a savage catch me hackin' up wood doin' damage
I'm just sayin' I ain't goin' out like that
Got a feather behind my ear beneath my cowboy hat
Got a years worth of deer, you can count on that
Like a steakhouse, I'm out back

[Chorus]
Let's have a good time
Cigarette butts and moonshine
I'm goin' redneck tonight
I got my horse by my side
Full tank of gas in my ride

I'm just tryna have a good time
Cigarette butts and moonshine
I'm goin' redneck tonight
I got my horse by my side
Full tank of gas in my ride
