"I'd just like to know how anyone can be absolutely positive of who's the ""oldest"" person on Earth. Do they go to the tribes that never let outsiders in without killing the intruder? Do they somehow manage to get an answer as to how old everyone there is, to make sure there's nobody older than someone in a civilized part of the world, and after they send out the verified info, the tribe kills them? 
I mean, come on, it's impossible to know who is the oldest person on Earth at any given time.
