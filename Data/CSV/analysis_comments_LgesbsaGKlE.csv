I'm happy that Asulka is back. However I thought that once a wrestler who held any title. And lost it. Couldn't get another shot for it. For along time. I.E. had to start at the bottom again. WTAF made Becky think that she could just. Jump back in to the title hunt. All of the others had to start again. This is what happens when you are a greedy contact holder. You think you can do whatever you want to.,0.1027,Positive,0.2666666666666666,Positive,0.2690386474132538,Neutral
