"LYRICS:
Mamaaa,
Just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger,
Now he's dead
Mamaaa, life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, oooh,
Didn't mean to make you cry,
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all
The time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, oooh
I don't want to die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.

I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio

You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly

So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know, or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (radio)

All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years

Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things, on you we depend
So stick around, 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (radio)

All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo

All we hear is radio ga ga

Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street, gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face, you big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place, singin'

We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you're a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street, gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face, you big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place

We will, we will rock you, sing it!
We will, we will rock you, yeah

Buddy, you're an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes, gonna get you some peace someday
You got mud on your face, big disgrace
Somebody better put you back into your place, do it!

We will, we will rock you, yeah, yeah, come on
We will, we will rock you, alright, louder!
We will, we will rock you, one more time
We will, we will rock you
Yeah

I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand
Kicked in my face
But I've come through

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions of the World

I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune
And everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before
The human race
And I ain't gonna lose

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers

"I remember being there and I had never seen so many people in my life 

The audience was huge and packed front to back and there were people who were still trying to get in!

And it was my first time I had smelled so much pot like every where lol 

And then I was allowed to see queen from backstage or really more like the side and I don't know from what perspective the energy was more intense 

Be it from the audience or from the stage it's self it was none the less very exciting

But everyone in the audience and even in the hallways of the stadium kept commenting on not only how loud it was but that it was the best sound quality they ever experienced compared to other concerts.

I believe aside from the bands who played there and their own great performances that it was the sound quality that made the concert one of the most  memorable shows ever and surely one of the best experiences to ever have.",0.9881,Positive,0.4186805555555555,Positive,0.7264095544815063,Positive

What most people forget is that up until that point the music at Live Aid had been pretty average. U2 had livened things up but the music in the afternoon was really from bands who weren’t used to playing packed stadiums and who had built their careers on pop songs and videos and weren’t able to pull off a twenty minute set. Queen and then Bowie and Elton John really got things going. And out of everyone it’s the Queen  who everyone remembers. Truly one of the great performances ever.,0.9218,Positive,0.3045454545454545,Positive,0.843730628490448,Positive

I  was at live aid and what makes this so special is that Queen have choreographed a concert into a 20 minute slot. Most other acts from the Who to Paul Mccartney just played a set of four of five songs and went off for the next act. What Queen did was to play the audience with a musical operetta of their hits and with such great showman to do it. It really did lift the crowd and you can see that. Its a masterclass in how to fill 20 minutes of rock music. I doubt any other band would or could do it but that it was makes Freddie so special.,0.8802,Positive,0.1909681227863046,Positive,0.6697760820388794,Positive

"A comment was made that Live Aid was more than ""just Queen"".  When it came to performance sets as far as music, YES, Queen took the #1 spot. The viewers watched this epic 16 hour show to donate and enjoy the music. Queen took it extremely serious and did exactly what they were supposed to do, and absolutely nailed it. They were brilliant & they rehearsed it; a lot! Most important; they were there for the CAUSE; not to promote. So, yeah, there is quite a bit to hype about over them.  If anyone is interested in the behind scenes on why they excelled, watch the video from Wings of Pegasus (awesome guy) on 'why Queen were so good at Live Aid'.  Fil explains it in detail, and the appreciation for what Queen did simply puts a deep appreciation for it. Other than that, keep enjoying this decades later to all of the bands that performed. ✌💖",0.9926,Positive,0.2530663780663781,Positive,0.392568439245224,Positive
