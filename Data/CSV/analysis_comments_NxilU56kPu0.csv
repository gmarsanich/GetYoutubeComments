Gonna buy some Beanie Babies, new with tag
From some guy I've never met in Norway
Found him on eBay
I am the type who is liable to snipe you
With two seconds left to go, whoa
Got PayPal or Visa, whatever'll please ya
As long as I've got the dough
I'll buy your tchotchkes
Sell me your watch, please

I'll buy, I'll buy, I'll buy, I'll buy

Wanna buy a case of vintage tube socks
Wanna buy a Kleenex used by Dr. Dre (used by Dr. Dre)

"Lyrics:


Hey! Look at me!
I'm sitting here sad and lonely!

Without a fire
But a desire
To not hear you say
""I have a boyfriend!""

And I see da ladies walking
Along one by one
And I never wanna hear
""I have a boyfriend!""

Tell me why
I'm stuck as a virgin with rage!
Tell me why
I so need a cute girl my age!
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
""I have a boyfriend!""

And I have no fire
But a desire
To not hear you say
""I have a boyfriend!""

Tell me why
I'm stuck as a virgin with rage!
Tell me why
I so need a cute girl my age!
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
""I have a boyfriend!""

Why do all of the jerks
Get all of the pretty girls? (Yeah!)
You may not notice
But I want you to know
That I am a lonesome heart!

And I have no fire
But a desire
To not, to not, to not
Heeeaaar‚Ä¶

Stuck as a virgin with rage!
So need a cute girl my age!
I never wanna hear you say
""I have a boyfriend!""
Tell me why
I'm stuck as a virgin with rage!
Tell me why
I so need a cute girl my age!
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say

Tell me why

Ionic compounds
Covalent conpounds
Different compounds

You think it's hard
But it's just easy
Just watch
And learn
The different compounds

An Ionic, consist of cations and anions
Held together by electrostatic forces
They have to donate, so electrons must ve given away

Opposite charges 
Attract each other
And
That is 
Ionic bonding


Next we have,
Covalent bondinggIt's when atoms
 interact with each other
Now electron were distributed

"The true lyrics:

Hey! Look at me!
I'm sitting here sad and lonely!
Without a fire,
But a desire
To not hear you say,
""I have a boyfriend!""
And I see da ladies walking
Along one by one,
And I never wanna hear,
""I have a boyfriend!""
Tell me why
I'm stuck as a virgin with rage!
Tell me why
I so need a cute girl my age!
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say,
""I have a boyfriend!""
And I have no fire
But a desire
To not hear you say,
""I have a boyfriend!""
Tell me why
I'm stuck as a virgin with rage!
(Tell me why)
I so need a cute girl my age!
(Tell me why)
I never wanna hear you say,
""I have a boyfriend!""
Why do all of the jerks
Get all of the pretty girls? (Yeah!)
You may not notice,
But I want you to know
That I am a lonesome heart!
And I have no fire,
But a desire
To not, to not, to not
Heeeaaar‚Ä¶
Stuck as a virgin with rage!
So need a cute girl my age!
I never wanna hear you say,
""I have a boyfriend!""
Tell me why
I'm stuck as a virgin with rage!
(Tell me why)
I so need a cute girl my age!
I never wanna hear you say,
""I have a boyfriend!""
Tell me why
I'm stuck as a virgin with rage!
I so need a cute girl my age!

[Brian:]
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way

[Nick:]
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

[Chorus:]
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

[AJ:]
Am I your fire
Your one desire
Yes I know it's too late
But I want it that way

[Chorus:]
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

[Kevin:]
Now I can see that we're falling apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance
I want you to know
That deep down inside of me...

[Howie:]
You are my fire
The one desire
You are
You are, you are, you are

Don't wanna hear you say
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake (don't wanna hear you say)
I never wanna hear you say (oh, yeah)
I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say (don't wanna hear you say)
I want it that way

Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
