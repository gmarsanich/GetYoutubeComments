"look i dont wanna be mean but my family and i were using this for kareoke and it SUCKED half of your 'lyrics' were WRONG ( at least search up the lyrics if you dont know them,because you put a uestion mark for a part.) btw here are the ACTUALL lyrics : I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready
Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall
And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us (huh)
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
Uh, look
Okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
P-P-Posted, being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em hasta luego
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic
Quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking
Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
Batter, batter up, who the baddest?
It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Pray it away, I swear
I'll never be a saint, no way

I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us

Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready

Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall
And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us (huh)

Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)

Uh, look
Okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
P-P-Posted, being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em hasta luego
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic
Quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking
Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
Batter, batter up, who the baddest?
It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat

Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy

Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy

Pray it away, I swear
I'll never be a saint, no way
My enemy
Pray it away, I swear
I'll never be a saint

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Look out for yourself

[Verse 1: Dan Reynolds]
I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
From my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that I told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned

[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready

[Verse 2: Dan Reynolds]
Your words up on the wall as you'r–µ prayin' for my fall
And th–µ laughter in th–µ halls and the names that I'v–µ been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like to be worse [?]
[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us (Huh)

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds & JID]
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy-y-y-y-y (Yeah)
(Look out for yourself)
Uh, look, okay

[Verse 3: JID]
I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me
I'm staying with nobody close to me
P-P-Posted, being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The energy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em, ""Hasta luego""
They wanna plot on my drive to the top
I've been out of shape, thinking out the box
I'm an astronaut
I blast it off of the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it
Now, had I thought about wreaking havoc
On an opposition, kinda shocking
They want a static with precision
I'm automatic, hold it back
I ain't talking sack and pack it
Pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up
Who the baddest?
It don't matter 'cause we is just‚Äî
[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy


Ayo-ay, I swear I never be insane-oh-ay
My enemy
Ayo-ay, I swear I never be insane
(Look out for yourself)

"I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us

Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready

Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall
And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us (huh)

Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)

Uh, look
Okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
P-P-Posted, being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em hasta luego
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic
Quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking
Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
Batter, batter up, who the baddest?
It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat

Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy

Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy

Pray it away, I swear
I'll never be a saint, no way
