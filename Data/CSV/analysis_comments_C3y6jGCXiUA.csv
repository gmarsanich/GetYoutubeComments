"I got my driver's license last week
Por fin obtuve mi licencia
Just like we always talked about
Como sol√≠amos platicar
'Cause you were so excited for me
Quer√≠a darte la sorpresa
To finally drive up to your house
Por fin tu casa visitar
But today I drove through the suburbs
Pero hoy conduzco por la calle
Crying 'cause you weren't around
Llorando al no verte pasar

And you're probably with that blonde girl
¬øEst√°s con esa chica
Who always made me doubt
que me hace dudar?
She's so much older than me
Hace que me intimide
She's everything I'm insecure about
Que crezca cada inseguridad
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
Pero hoy conduzco por la calle
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
No podr√© amar a nadie m√°s

And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
S√© que no fue perfecto, pero amor as√≠ no hab√≠a sentido
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Y no puedo creer que estar√°s bien ahora que me he ido
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
No era verdad lo que escribiste acerca de m√≠
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
Dijiste ‚Äúpor siempre‚Äù, pero ahora te ver√© partir

And all my friends are tired
Y todos mis amigos
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
Seguro hartos ya est√°n
I kinda feel sorry for them
¬øY c√≥mo no sentirlo?
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah
Ellos como yo no te conocer√°n
Today I drove through the suburbs

"Here's a rewrite. Suits me more bc I never really been in a relationship.
It would be called 'Lemonade Stand.'


Started a lemonade stand last week.
Just like we always talked about.
You were so excited for me.
To bring the money to your house.
But today I just stood around.
Waiting for customers to come out.
And you probably forgot about me.
Sometimes you make me doubt.
That this friendship was important.
Like the lemonade selling out.
But now I stand around.
Cause how could I ever do anything else.
And I know you didn't like my ideas but you were always there for me.
And how can you feel so okay everything we worked for is destroyed and now its gone.
Guess you didn't need me to help you with that scheme.
Cause you said together, now I stand alone, selling tea.
And my family is tired of hearing how much I waste.
But I recently got hired to market cupcakes.
Now I just stand around.
Thinking of commercial brands.
And I know you didn't like my ideas but you were always there for me.
And how can you feel so okay everything we worked for is destroyed and now its gone.
Guess you didn't need me to help you with that scheme.
Cause you said together, now I stand alone, marketing sweets.
Your late.
Your hurt.
Same old lies and the same old stories.
Its always my fault.
Same old stories and same old lies.
(This part goes on a bit. I didn't really know what to do)
And I know you didn't like my ideas but you were always there for me.
And how can you feel so okay everything we worked for is destroyed and now its gone.
Guess you didn't mean it when you said you needed me.

"Eu tirei minha carteira ontem
Como a gente sempre conversou
C√™ tava animada por mim
Pra que eu pudesse passar pelo seu jardim
Mas hoje eu dirijo pelas ruas
Chorando a luz da lua 

E provavelmente t√° com aquele cara
Que sempre me fez mal
Ele √© mais velho que eu
E meu medo √© que ele v√° te fazer mal
Sim, hoje eu dirigi pelas ruas
Pensando em como te esquecer 

Eu sei que eu n√£o era perfeito
Mas eu nunca me senti desse jeito por ningu√©m
E eu nem consigo imaginar
Como voc√™ pode t√° t√£o bem, com outro algu√©m
Acho que voc√™ n√£o falou s√©rio quando disse pra mim
Que era ‚Äúpra sempre‚Äù e agora tudo chegou ao fim 

E os meus amigos n√£o aguentam
Mais ouvir falar
E eu n√£o os culpo porque
Eles nunca v√£o saber como foi te amar 

Sim, hoje eu dirigi pelas ruas
Pensando em ir at√© voc√™ 

Eu sei que eu n√£o era perfeito
Mas eu nunca me senti desse jeito por ningu√©m
E eu nem consigo imaginar
Como voc√™ pode t√° t√£o bem, com outro algu√©m
Acho que voc√™ n√£o falou s√©rio quando disse pra mim
Que era ‚Äúpra sempre‚Äù e agora tudo chegou ao fim 

Olhar, brilhar
Eu ainda vejo seu rosto em carros, telhados
N√£o consigo parar de pensar no outono, eu questiono
Porque eu ainda te amo amor? 

Te abra√ßar, na pra√ßa
Eu ainda te escuto nas ruas, escuras
No meio do barulho
Isso √© t√£o novo, imaturo 
Porque eu ainda te amo amor? (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) 

Eu sei que eu n√£o era perfeito
Mas eu nunca me senti desse jeito por ningu√©m 

E nem consigo imaginar
Como voc√™ pode estar t√£o bem, com outro algu√©m

Original¬†Tradu√ß√£o

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way, for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever
Now I drive alone past your street
All my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you
But I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you
The way that I do, yeah
Today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way, for no one, oh-oh
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay, now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever
Now I drive alone past your street

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to, go to
'Cause I still fucking love you, babe (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we cross
I still hear your voice in the traffic
We're laughing over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fucking love you, babe (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way, for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay, now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever
Now I drive alone past your street
Yeah, you said forever
Now I drive alone past your street

carteira de motorista
Recebi minha carteira de motorista semana passada
Como a gente sempre conversava
Porque voc√™ estava t√£o empolgado que eu
Finalmente fosse dirigir at√© sua casa
Mas hoje eu dirigi pelos sub√∫rbios
Chorando porque voc√™ n√£o estava comigo
E voc√™ provavelmente est√° com aquela garota loira
A que sempre me fez duvidar
Ela √© muito mais velha que eu
Ela √© tudo aquilo que me deixa insegura
Sim, hoje eu dirigi pelos sub√∫rbios
Porque como eu poderia amar outra pessoa?
E eu sei que n√£o √©ramos perfeitos
Mas nunca me senti assim por ningu√©m
E eu nem consigo imaginar
Como voc√™ pode estar t√£o bem, agora que eu fui embora?
Acho que voc√™ n√£o estava falando s√©rio naquela m√∫sica que escreveu sobre mim
Porque voc√™ disse que seria para sempre
Agora eu dirijo sozinha pela sua rua
Todos os meus amigos est√£o cansados
De me ouvir falando o quanto eu sinto sua falta
Mas eu meio que sinto pena deles
Porque eles nunca v√£o te conhecer
Do jeito que eu te conhe√ßo, √©
Hoje eu dirigi pelos sub√∫rbios
E me imaginei indo para casa encontrar voc√™
E eu sei que n√£o √©ramos perfeitos
Mas nunca me senti assim por ningu√©m, oh-oh
E eu nem consigo imaginar
Como voc√™ pode estar t√£o bem, agora que eu fui embora?
Acho que voc√™ n√£o estava falando s√©rio naquela m√∫sica que escreveu sobre mim
Porque voc√™ disse que seria para sempre
Agora eu dirijo sozinha pela sua rua
Luzes vermelhas, placas de Pare
Eu ainda vejo seu rosto em carros brancos, jardins
N√£o consigo passar pelos lugares que costum√°vamos ir
Porque eu ainda te amo pra caralho, amor (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Cal√ßadas que atravessamos
Eu ainda escuto sua voz no tr√¢nsito
N√≥s dois rindo por cima de todo aquele barulho
Deus, eu estou t√£o triste, sei que terminamos
Mas eu ainda te amo pra caralho, meu amor (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
E eu sei que n√£o √©ramos perfeitos
Mas nunca me senti assim por ningu√©m
E eu nem consigo imaginar
Como voc√™ poderia estar t√£o bem, agora que eu fui embora?
Acho que voc√™ n√£o estava falando s√©rio naquela m√∫sica que escreveu sobre mim
Porque voc√™ disse que seria para sempre
Agora eu dirijo sozinha pela sua rua
Porque voc√™ disse que seria para sempre
Agora eu dirijo sozinha pela sua rua

licencia de conducir
Consegu√≠ mi licencia de conducir la semana pasada
Como siempre habl√°bamos que lo har√≠a
Porque estabas tan emocionado por m√≠
Para finalmente conducir hasta tu casa
Pero hoy conduje por los suburbios
Llorando, porque no estabas cerca

Y probablemente est√°s con esa chica rubia
La que siempre me hizo sospechar
Ella es mucho mayor que yo
Ella es todo lo que me hace insegura

S√≠, hoy conduje por los suburbios
Porque ¬øc√≥mo yo podr√≠a amar a alguien m√°s?

Y s√© que no √©ramos perfectos
Pero nunca me he sentido as√≠ por nadie
Y simplemente no puedo imaginar
C√≥mo podr√≠as estar tan bien ahora que me he ido
Y creo que no lo dec√≠as en serio en esa canci√≥n que escribiste sobre m√≠
Porque dijiste que lo nuestro era para siempre
Ahora conduzco sola por tu calle

Y todos mis amigos est√°n hartos
De escucharme diciendo cu√°nto te extra√±o
Pero siento un poco de pena por ellos
Porque nunca te conocer√°n
Como te conozco, s√≠

Hoy conduje por los suburbios
Y me imagin√© conduciendo a casa contigo

Y s√© que no √©ramos perfectos
Pero nunca me he sentido as√≠ por nadie, oh-oh
Y simplemente no puedo imaginar
C√≥mo podr√≠as estar tan bien ahora que me he ido
Y creo que no lo dec√≠as en serio en esa canci√≥n que escribiste sobre m√≠
Porque dijiste que lo nuestro era para siempre
Ahora conduzco sola por tu calle

Luces rojas, se√±al de stop
Todav√≠a veo tu cara en carros blancos, jardines
No puedo pasar por los lugares que sol√≠amos ir
Porque todav√≠a te amo mucho, mi amor (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

Veredas que cruzamos
A√∫n escucho tu voz en el tr√°fico, t√∫ y yo ri√©ndonos
Incluso con todo el ruido
Por Dios, estoy tan triste, s√© que rompimos
Pero todav√≠a te amo mucho, mi amor (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

S√© que no √©ramos perfectos
Pero nunca me he sentido as√≠ por nadie
Y simplemente no puedo imaginar
C√≥mo podr√≠as estar tan bien ahora que me he ido
Y creo que no lo dec√≠as en serio en esa canci√≥n que escribiste sobre m√≠

"drivers license Toxic Friendship Edition 
[Verse 1]
I haven‚Äôt got my driver‚Äôs license 
That‚Äôs what you always talked about
‚ÄòCause you were so excited for me 
To finally‚ÄÖdrive us to the lake
But today‚ÄÖI went to the theatre
Smiling 'cause you weren't around

[Verse 2]
You're‚Åüprobably‚Åüin your bedroom
And crying your eyes out
I know you think you‚Äôre guiltless 
I know why you think I‚Äôm the villain now
Yeah, today I went to the theatre
'Cause you hurt me but I won‚Äôt tell you how  

[Chorus]
And I know you were happy
But I've never felt this pain from no one
And I just can't believe that I‚Äôm not crying 
I‚Äôm okay now that you're gone
Guess I didn't mean what I wrote in that song for your birthday
‚ÄòCause I thought you loved me, but you blew wind into the heat 

[Verse 3]
And all your friends are phony 
But they might be better for you, and 
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know that you like to lie too, yeah
Today I walked to the theatre 
And pictured I was in there without you 

[Chorus]
And I know you were happy 
But I've never felt this pain from no one, oh
And I just can't believe that I‚Äôm not crying 
I‚Äôm okay now that you're gone
I guess I didn't mean what I wrote in that song for your birthday
‚ÄòCause I thought you loved me, but you‚Äôre never happy for me 

[Bridge]
Wide-eyed, long nights 
I still see your eyes in the dark now, tears now
Never understood you and your cold heart, bad art
'Cause I know that I hurt you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Fine lines you crossed
I still hear your voice in the call now, your dead now
Wish I never met you
‚ÄòCause I hate you, glad we're through
'Cause you can‚Äôt stand to lose a fight (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
And I know you were happy
But I've never felt this pain from no one
And I just can't believe that I‚Äôm not crying 
I‚Äôm okay now that you're gone
‚ÄòCause I hate that song that I shouldn‚Äôt have wrote for your birthday

J'entends encore ta voix dans les bouchons, on rit
Plus fort que tout le bruit

To finally drive up to your house

Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about

I kinda feel sorry for them

"I got my driver‚Äôs license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around
And you're‚Åüprobably‚Åüwith‚Åüthat blonde girl

She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about

And all my friends are tired

I kinda feel sorry for them

I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh)

"Tradu√ß√£o:

Recebi minha carteira de motorista semana passada
Como a gente sempre conversava
Porque voc√™ estava t√£o empolgado que eu
Finalmente fosse dirigir at√© sua casa
Mas hoje eu dirigi pelos sub√∫rbios
Chorando porque voc√™ n√£o estava comigo

E voc√™ provavelmente est√° com aquela garota loira
A que sempre me fez duvidar
Ela √© muito mais velha que eu
Ela √© tudo aquilo que me deixa insegura

Sim, hoje eu dirigi pelos sub√∫rbios
Porque como eu poderia amar outra pessoa?

E eu sei que n√£o √©ramos perfeitos
Mas nunca me senti assim por ningu√©m
E eu nem consigo imaginar
Como voc√™ pode estar t√£o bem, agora que eu fui embora?
Acho que voc√™ n√£o estava falando s√©rio naquela m√∫sica que escreveu sobre mim
Porque voc√™ disse que seria para sempre
Agora eu dirijo sozinha pela sua rua

Todos os meus amigos est√£o cansados
De me ouvir falando o quanto eu sinto sua falta
Mas eu meio que sinto pena deles
Porque eles nunca v√£o te conhecer
Do jeito que eu te conhe√ßo, √©

Hoje eu dirigi pelos sub√∫rbios
E me imaginei indo para casa encontrar voc√™

E eu sei que n√£o √©ramos perfeitos
Mas nunca me senti assim por ningu√©m, oh-oh
E eu nem consigo imaginar
Como voc√™ pode estar t√£o bem, agora que eu fui embora?
Acho que voc√™ n√£o estava falando s√©rio naquela m√∫sica que escreveu sobre mim
Porque voc√™ disse que seria para sempre
Agora eu dirijo sozinha pela sua rua

Luzes vermelhas, placas de Pare
Eu ainda vejo seu rosto em carros brancos, jardins
N√£o consigo passar pelos lugares que costum√°vamos ir
Porque eu ainda te amo pra caralho, amor (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

Cal√ßadas que atravessamos
Eu ainda escuto sua voz no tr√¢nsito
N√≥s dois rindo por cima de todo aquele barulho
Deus, eu estou t√£o triste, sei que terminamos
Mas eu ainda te amo pra caralho, meu amor (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

E eu sei que n√£o √©ramos perfeitos
Mas nunca me senti assim por ningu√©m
E eu nem consigo imaginar
Como voc√™ poderia estar t√£o bem, agora que eu fui embora?
Acho que voc√™ n√£o estava falando s√©rio naquela m√∫sica que escreveu sobre mim
Porque voc√™ disse que seria para sempre
Agora eu dirijo sozinha pela sua rua
Porque voc√™ disse que seria para sempre

"I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah
Today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay, now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay, now that I'm gone
'Cause you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
