"I've heard about this baby boy
Who's come to earth to bring us joy
And I just want to sing this song to you
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
With every breath I'm singing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

A couple came to Bethlehem
Expecting child, they searched the inn
To find a place for You were coming soon
And there was no room for them to stay
So in a manger filled with hay
God's only Son was born, oh Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

The shepherds left their flocks by night
To see this baby wrapped in light
A host of angels led them all to You
It was just as the angels said
You'll find Him in a manger bed
Immanuel and Savior, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

A star shown bright up in the east
To Bethlehem, the wisemen three
Came many miles and journeyed long for You
And to the place at which You were
Their frankincense and gold and myrrh
They gave to You and cried out Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I know You came to rescue me
This baby boy would grow to be
A man and one day die for me and you
My sins would drive the nails in You
That rugged cross was my cross, too
Still every breath You drew was Hallelujah

Lecz sprawił to księżyca blask

Ostrzygła cię i już nie masz sił
I z gardła ci wydarła: alleluja!

ca lăuta lui David din psalmi,
Pornește de la tine și se întoarce la tine.

Nu-ți fie teamă, credința ta este suficient de lungă!
Aleluia, aleluia,
aleluia, aleluia!

(Nu am pământ și nici proprietate,
inca primesc ce imi trebuie
Înțelegi totul, ai grijă de mine.
Mulțumesc că nu minți niciodată
nu judeci deși știi despre păcatul meu
lasă acest Aleluia să sune diferit acum!
Aleluia, aleluia,
aleluia, aleluia!)

Tu ești unde dragostea învinge,
unde îndoiala este precedată de certitudine,
aici ești, simt, mă simt neîncetat,
ca lumina în gaura cheii mele
sau cheie la pian,
și eu doar stau, cu inima în flăcări.
Aleluia, aleluia,
aleluia, aleluia!

Mulțumesc pentru viața de astăzi,
că pot fi mai mult în fiecare zi,
că cuvântul sună atât de clar pe buzele mele.

glorie tie, multumesc inca o data!

"Hallom létezett egykor egy titkos akkord,
Amit Dávid játszott és az Úr kedvére volt
S bár téged nem érdekel, elmondom újra.
Az ötös követte a négyeset,
Egy moll, egy dúr, s máris megszületett
S a király zavarban súgta: Halleluja
Halleluja, Halleluja, Halleluja, Halleluja.

Bizonyság kellett, bár volt hited,
A háztetőn állt, s hosszan nézhetted,
A hold fényében fürdött, kivirulva.
És megbűvölt, és levágta hajad,
Leláncolt, széttörte trónodat,
És ajkadról ellopta végleg: Halleluja.
Halleluja, Halleluja, Halleluja, Halleluja.

Tudod, jártam már régen itt,
Ismerem szobádnak sarkait,
Magányon át vitt Hozzád a véletlen útja.
A díszkapun láttam a címeredet,
De a szerelem nem dicső fáklyásmenet,
Csak egy fázós, kicsit fáradt: Halleluja.
Halleluja, Halleluja, Halleluja, Halleluja.

És volt idő, hogy elmondtad még,
Hogy ott, belül milyen a helyzet épp,
De ezt már sose hallom tőled újra.
Pedig úgy költöztem én beléd,
Hogy galambot hoztam, hogy : Nézd, de szép.
És együtt lélegeztük: Halleluja.
Halleluja, Halleluja, Halleluja, Halleluja.

Mondod, a nevet csak bitorlom,
S én azt a nevet még csak nem is tudom,
De mit számít neked, ha bárki tudja!?
Mert minden szóban fény ragyog,
És mindegy melyiket hallgatod,
Hogy Szent, vagy összetört a Halleluja.
Halleluja, Halleluja, Halleluja, Halleluja.

Én próbáltam, hát ennyi telt,
Kezemre érintés nem felelt,
Igazat mondok, bármily szép, vagy csúnya
S bár meglehet, hogy tévedek,
A dal ura elé úgy léphetek,
Hogy nyelvemen nincsen más, mint: Halleluja.
Halleluja, Halleluja, Halleluja, Halleluja.

"A crown of thorns placed on His head
He knew that He would soon be dead
He said, ""Did you forget me, Father did you?""
They nailed Him to a wooden cross
Soon all the world would feel the loss
Of Christ the King before His Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
He hung His head and prepared to die
Then lifted His face up to the sky
Said, ""I am coming home now Father, to you""
A reed which held His final sip
Was gently lifted to his lips
He drank His last and gave His soul to glory
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
The soldier who had used his sword
To pierce the body of our Lord
Said, ""Truly, this was Jesus Christ our Savior""
He looked with fear upon his sword
Then turned to face his Christ and Lord
Fell to his knees crying Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Took from his head the thorny crown
And wrapped him in a linen gown
Then laid him down to rest inside the tomb
The holes in his hands, his feet and side
Now in our hearts we know he died
To save us from ourselves, oh Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Three days went by, again they came
To move the stone, to bless the slain
With oil and spice anointing Hallelujah
But as they went to move the stone
They saw that they were not alone
For Jesus Christ has risen, Hallelujah

"Virgin’s Hands

Translated by Ron

 
Fair hands, both soft and silk-like
whenever you touch my hair
all the doubts that I keep inside
are all completely forgotten.

And like a blooming flower,
your fingers are petals of beauty;
that whenever I touch, Oh fair darling,
is like kissing the rose itself.

Kind hands, with softness of cotton
with a swirl at the center that gathers inside,
Beautiful hands that seems to have the cure,
with a simple touch heals a hundred wounds.

Similar to gentle, white birds
that could sleep at their chests
with a single kiss of mine it begins to open
and at my cheeks it feels so sweet.

As the story goes, the hands of a virgin
are gentle and without fault;
I who am evil when I adored you
Becomes very kind when touched by you.",0.9905,Positive,0.2226984126984127,Positive,0.542161226272583,Positive

Un soldado a casa hoy regresó
Y un niño enfermo se curó
Y hoy no hay trabajo en el bosque de la lluvia

Un desamparado se salvó
Por causa de una buena acción
Y hoy nadie lo repudia, Aleluya

Aleluya, Aleluya, Aleluya, Aleluya

Un ateo que consiguió creer
Y un hambriento hoy tiene de comer
Y hoy donaron a una iglesia una fortuna

Que la guerra pronto se acabará
Que en el mundo al fin reinará la paz
Que no habrá miseria alguna, Aleluya

Aleluya, Aleluya, Aleluya, Aleluya

Por que la norma sea el amor
Y no gobierne la corrupción
Sino lo bueno y lo mejor del alma pura

Porque dios nos proteja de un mal final
Porque un día podamos escarmentar
Con que acaben con tanta furia, Aleluya

"Poti sa-ncerci
Sa prinzi luna cazuta in put
Sau sa dai unui om necajit un banut

Crescute-ntre spini
Sau sa rizi dupa ce ai incetat sa suspini

Daca-n sufletul tau sta de veghe Hristos
Dup-o noapte de dus rasaritul frumos
Si-auzi ingerii cum cinta, Aleluia.

Aleluia, Aleluia.

Pentru darul divin de a fi ceea ce esti
O porunca ai doar de urmat: Sa iubesti!
Si-un dusman si un prieten
Cu aceeasi egala masura
Doar asa-ti va zimbi neincetat Dumnezeu
Si-ai sa poti fi

That David played, and it pleased the Lord

Our nation sought to build on these
A victory for all under our freedom
Well the darkness came and then it went
We built a home and watched it sink
And from the rubble
Emerged my great

"A crown of thorns placed on His head
He knew that He would soon be dead
He said, ""Did you forget me, Father did you?""
They nailed Him to a wooden cross
Soon all the world would feel the loss
Of Christ the King before His Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
He hung His head and prepared to die
Then lifted His face up to the sky
Said, ""I am coming home now Father, to you""
A reed which held His final sip
Was gently lifted to his lips
He drank His last and gave His soul to glory
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
The soldier who had used his sword
To pierce the body of our Lord
Said, ""Truly, this was Jesus Christ our Savior""
He looked with fear upon his sword
Then turned to face his Christ and Lord
Fell to his knees crying Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Took from his head the thorny crown
And wrapped him in a linen gown
Then laid him down to rest inside the tomb
The holes in his hands, his feet and side
Now in our hearts we know he died
To save us from ourselves, oh Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Three days went by, again they came
To move the stone, to bless the slain
With oil and spice anointing Hallelujah
But as they went to move the stone
They saw that they were not alone

Our nation sought to build on these
A victory for all under our freedom
Well the darkness came and then it went
We built a home and watched it sink
And from the rubble
Emerged my great
L’Manburg
[Chorus]
My L’manburg
My L’manburg
My L’manburg
My L’manburg

[Verse 3]
With bloodied hands
And weakened knees
Our peoplе rose like
The phoеnix
Our empty fields and canals ‘round
L’Mantree
With sweat and tears we armed our ranks
We laid foundations in our land
And from every lips fro here up to infinity

"L'Manburg Anthem o7

I heard there was a special place,

where men could go and emancipate,

the brutality

and tyranny

of their rulers.

Well, this place is real,

you needn’t fret,

with Wilbur, Tommy, Tubbo, f*** Eret

It's A very big and not blown up L’Manburg.



My L’Manburg,

My L’Manburg.

My L’Manburg,

My L’Manburg.



For freedom and for liberty,

our nation sought to build on these,

a victory for all under our freedom.

Well the darkness came and then it went,

we built a home and watched it end.

And from the rubble,

emerged my great

L’Manburg.



My L’manburg,

My L’manburg.

My L’manburg,

My L’manburg.


With hands, bloodied

and knees, feeble.

Our people rose like

The Grand Eagle,

Our empty fields and canals ‘round

L’Mantree.

With sweat and tears we armed our ranks.

We laid foundations in our land.

And all lips from here up to forever


We sing L’Manburg,

We sing L’Manburg.

"Full Lyrics for My L'Manberg 
(Text new written by Wilbur Soot/Ghostbur) 
Orginal Song: Hallelujah


(Verse 1)
I heard there was a special place,
Where men could go, emancipate
The brutality And tyranny of their rulers.
Well this place is real you needn't fret
With Wilbur, Tommy, Tubbo, fuck Eret
A very big and not blown up L'Manberg

(Chorus)
My L'Manberg
My L'Manberg
My L'Manberg
My L'Manberg

(Verse 2)
For freedom and for liberty
Our Nation sought to build on these
A victory for all under democracy
Well the darkness came and then it went,
We built a home and watched it sink
And from the rubble, there emerged L'Manberg

(Chorus)
My L'Manberg
My L'Manberg
My L'Manberg
My L'Manberg

(Verse 3)
With bloodied hands and weakened knees,
Our people rose like the phoenix
Our empty fields and canals 'round L'Mantree
With sweat and tears we armed our ranks,
We laid foundations in our land
And from every lips from here up to infinity

(Chorus)
We sing L'Manberg
We sing L'Manberg
We sing L'Manberg
To our L'Manberg",0.7579,Positive,0.1048340548340548,Positive,0.3719698786735534,Positive

My L'Manberg
My L'Manberg
My L'Maaaaanberg

With hands bloodied
And knees feeble
Our people rose like
The Grand Eagle
Our empty fields and canals round
L'Mantree
With sweat and tears we arm our ranks
We laid foundations in our land
And all lips from here up to forever

"1 Question to you @Sing King ...
Is it allowed to do this, what you do? Making the Karaoke Videos, because... dont you need a License of the song?
If its allowed, because you did the melody by yourself. Are your videos copyright-protected or can I use them in a Music-Stream on Twitch.
Because I want to sing the songs with the melody in the background.",0.168,Positive,0.0,Neutral,-0.4707525074481964,Negative
