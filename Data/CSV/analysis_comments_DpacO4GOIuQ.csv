"... your calculatios are a bit off... you need about 3000 redstone pistons use 1 per and observers 2 per quartz 1K iron 1K cobble 4x per piston 6x per observer means 10K Total ... than you can factor in the redstone that you need to place down .. the most efficient way is about 1 per 1 observer and 4 pistons ofcourse the edge would be 2/3 so to ease i am going to say about 250... or if you really want to play it safe 500 ... sinds yours is not really the optimal one i would jump these numbers about x2 to be safe so 500 in the lowest case 1000 in the highest bringing you to 3500-4000 redstone....not to mention the powered rail

which is dependend on how many you place because in the bamboo farm you used as little as possible the max number would be area / 6 area meaning that if you had the most optimal setup you would have 1000^2 which is square root of 1000=31,6 (rounding up for neat numbers) 32 rows on both sides to either fill or the least ... the least i would say 4 rows minimum (because corners can cause problems when not enough speed plus the bounce) 4x32 / 6= 21.3  ... 166.6 redstone if the ground is pammend with powered rail
but that is if you really want to get nerdy with it

and talking about being nerdy about it let me put the glass in perspective of how much you have used
length x hight + width x hight x2 -40 because corners
44 x 20 + 26 x 20 x2 -40=2760 sand/glass + or - a few becaus probable miscounting on screen.... but it is around that ... and not acounted for the glass on the inside or the glass ontop... which i am just going to estimate at about 5000-6000",0.7901,Positive,0.1092320261437908,Positive,0.5352152585983276,Positive
