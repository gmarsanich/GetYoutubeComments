Chaeyoung's problem - She chose Mina because she's her type but unfortunately Mina doesn't chose her back.
Mina's problem - Mina was calm all along as of now and choosing Momo to make her cheerf as she has OCD . (But deep inside she took revenge against Chaeyoung for hanging out with Somi more 😜)

"7:25 what I find interesting about Mina choosing Momo is that Mina's character seems to recognize that Momo's is dealing with a mental illness. It seems like many of the other characters would rather keep their distance, or take offence to Momo's obsession with sanitizing their hands. 

Of course, this is not a knock on the girls' real personalities; obviously, they're just role playing. Even if they individually know the seriousness of mental illness, the reality is the wider public lacks understanding. On an actually reality dating show, I doubt everyone would be empathetic to someone like Momo's character.",-0.128,Negative,0.0875,Positive,0.4426796734333038,Positive
