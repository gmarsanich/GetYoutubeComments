"Why are a third of the length his videos advertisements now? I thought he just did these videos for fun, I guess a hundred million dollars isn't enough. Either way NordVPN is an evil ass company that makes it almost impossible to cancel. There's a cancellation option in the downloaded app, but it doesn't actually cancel your subscription? So you think you cancelled but you still get charged for an extra month - as long as you realize what happened and cancel it on their website - if you can't find where to actually cancel the subscription on the website. The service I guess works, but it's tedious, and it's one extra program you have to have open while you're online. I decided it wasn't worth it, and then realized Nord is just a shady evil service that tries to force you to keep their crap.",-0.9706,Negative,-0.22156862745098038,Negative,-0.5279518961906433,Negative

"The drivers. That is legit me driving with my mom, i had my licens for 4 years and driven a lot. I was driving and we where talking about how if someone is driving u should never scream if u think they make a mistake cus they often have a plan and if u scream u could scare them into doing something wrong, and as we where talking i need to do a left turn to our house and she screams!! I cant, we where legit just talking about it. Needless to say i was coming in to fast on an icey road, but i was just using the other lane as a slow down lane for i had cars behind me. And i got some drifting on the car cus she let out a scream, and if she was just quiet i would have done it perfectly. Mom i cant.

"there is no context to the next sentence so don't worry if you think you're missing the ""point"" or ""hidden meaning"" of the next sentence.
Sarcasm is the most powerful type of humour that we can understand. The reason for this is because sarcasm requires the most intelligence to detect in text, if you can tell when someone is being sarcastic and when they aren't, you can count yourself as a smart person. No, that previous sentence was not sarcastic, it was the point I'm making. to summarize, to use sarcasm properly and effectively, you need to be a genius, and if you already are able to use sarcasm properly and effectively, then it is proof that you already are a genius. No, that wasn't sarcasm either (seriously).",0.9273,Positive,0.14103641456582633,Netural,0.2555806040763855,Netural
