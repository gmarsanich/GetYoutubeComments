"I keep 3 air guitars on the wall, in reach, so that when those massive May riffs and solos kick in, neither myself nor my kids have any excuse not to join in! 

While we all always think of Freddie as the hero of Queen, with that unimaginable vocal talent, the other guys together and only together, make something that no one has or will ever create again. Nothing will ever come close to this. Lives as iconic music along with the greatest pieces like Handle's Messiah, Bach's Toccata and Fugue.. breathtaking music that reaches into you and takes your breath away. Not just the first time, but every time you hear it. Long live the Queen!",0.8377,Positive,0.2682954545454545,Neutral,0.9036204814910888,Positive

"She keeps her Moet et Chandon
In her pretty cabinet
""Let them eat cake"", she says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy
For Khrushchev and Kennedy
At anytime an invitation
You can't decline

Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

She's a Killer Queen
Gunfire, guillotine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Asia Minor
Then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined

Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally)
For cars she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

She's a Killer Queen
Gunfire, guillotine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Drop of a hat she's as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild, wild
She's all out to get you

She's a Killer Queen
Gunfire, guillotine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

"this is all like explaining beyond mindfucked (retarded as though worried as a kid, like psychopathic)
:

buying something for the expressive purpose to make something to sell would be free market.

investing could fund it all. working could save for stocks.

""sell when they stop buying, buy when they start buying and only buy from a stock when there has been enough regular contribution to the trends of more buys to sell at a high enough price range to have made gains (by selling and avoiding potentially losing money by wishing against the trends or ticker prices.)

they'll likely buy after the selling stops to a settle based on the buy quantity's contributions that can be used or measured to figure potential for contributions of causing prices to rise when there is more contributions

and the prices would settle when there is not enough activity for having encouraged contributing to gaining for those potential gains, which would cause prices to lower because of the trend's settling lows caused by less contributions to the trends

and could maybe cause prices to go even lower when and because of less likelihood of foreseeable contributions. though foreseeable contributions would mean selling activity would stop, too (which might be a good time to buy.)

basically:
when investing, buying is really the only possible gamble if you're trying to make money regularly. sell when the prices go lower (as though ""when they sell"")(to not lose [as] much money [to have more money to buy more, to find a weekly paycheck regularly.])

compare previous activity with recent activity to determine likelihood of implications of uncharted activity - (sells, settles and buys [...settles, sells and settles... until more frequent activity] quantities elaborating duration as though magnitude for elevations or escalations of and because [of] activity encouraging accordingly figuring comparisons of likelihoods based on previous activity.)""

-------

may be good advice about religion:

if nervously heeding hope's concurrences while and for because of, potentially erratically, avoiding sadness or despair caused by frustration's exhaustion of hopeless endurances for helplessly regarding about, then take a hint of or about experiences when people speak their minds about expressed regards relatable.

don't put yourself in the concurring vulnerable position of relying on other people, because they'd make you rely on them to concur to be vulnerable. though be patient, if you think you are in the position of interrupting about disinterest of involvement seeming rude. don't be an idiot, though.

laugh by being hopelessly uninvolved about and because of not reacting about anger, expressed about and for urging regards from others and held because of enduring nervousness about bother long enough.

believe in your potential of avoidance (to find a way.)

could just empathize not stubbornly or ignore and disregard if misunderstanding to be in tune as yourself amongst potential experiences.

the realization is, ""i'm just as afraid (and agitatingly or agitatedly pacified about it) as they are."" that's how to learn how to settle down (and not concur about all the wrong things [to be and or just or feel involved about.])

""don't cause yourself to, unfortunately, be polite out of nervousness (for respecting them, anyone, which would make them nervous avoidantly, nervous recurringly enough to be shameful to reactively regard or helplessly endure and shamefulness is frustrating [to resolve non-elaborating expressiveness about to settle to realize uninvolvement to notice potential for appreciable involvements] which they'd blame for and potentially cause concurring regards reactively to figure differences like and about for uninvolvement about and because) as that's frustrating (which we'd obviously want to change to feel differently because of regarding differences because of having made concurring compromises, if concurring compromises were made for regarding, unsolicitedly.)""",-0.9879,Negative,-0.0223164682539682,Negative,-0.3143105208873749,Negative
"Well, it's a good selection, but I differ a bit, because apparently you only included ""HITS"" and if so, at the time (1978) ""Bicycle Race"" had a better ranking than ""It's a Hard Life"" (1984), the same with ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love"" (1979) or "" Flash"" (1980) instead of ""Who Wants to Live Forever"" (1986). Now, if you want to refer to ""best songs for quality"", I must ask where are in your selection songs like: 

""Doing All Right"", 
""White Queen"", 
""Nevermore"", 
""The March of the Black Queen"", 
""Tenement Funster"", 
""Flick of the Wrist"" , 
""Death on Two Legs"", 
""Love of My Life"", 
""You Take My Breath Away"", 
""The Millionaire Waltz"", 
""All Dead"", 
""Dead on Time"", 
""In Only Seven Days"", 
""Save Me"",
"" Princes of the Universe "",
"" Was It All Worth It ""   
 ""Bijou"" 

.... just to mention a few. But that's fine, because you will agree that there is not always a consensus on tastes .....

Time after time.
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime.

And bad mistakes‒
I've made a few.
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through.

And I need to go on and on, and on, and on.

And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end.

I've taken my bows,
And my curtain calls.
You brought me fame and fortune, and everything that goes with it.
I thank you all.

But it's been no bed of roses,
No pleasure cruise.
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race,
And I ain't gonna lose.

And I need just go on and on, and on, and on.

We are the champions, my friends.
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end.

"Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landside,
No escape from reality
Open your eyes,
Look up to the skies and see,
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
Because I'm easy come, easy go,
Little high, little low,
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to
Me, to me
Mamaaa,
Just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger,
Now he's dead
Mamaaa, life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, oooh,
Didn't mean to make you cry,
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all
The time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, oooh
I don't want to die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango!
Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo, Figaro - magnificoo
I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go)(Never) Never let you go
(Let me go) (Never) let you go (Let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me,
For meee
So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters,
Nothing really matters to me
