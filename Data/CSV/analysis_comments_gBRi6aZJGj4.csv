"Demonic music is an abomination to God. God, Jesus loves you all so much and wants you to turn away from anything evil that would distract you from Him. Time is short, Judgment on the world is approaching. Jesus Christ wants to have a relationship with you. Repentance of any and all sin (cheating, lying, adultery, sex outside of marriage, pornography, using the Lords name in vain...are all sin and must be repented of and turned away from). You may or may not believe in this, but Hell and Heaven are two REAL places. If you deny God and His goodness and turn to the ""evil one"" satan, you will find your place in Hell. you will experience Extreme torture much more intense then any torture here on earth, and for eternity (that means forever without stop). Satan uses demonic music to influence listeners. DO NOT OPEN THOSE DOORS by participating.",-0.9845,Negative,-0.048076923076923,Negative,-0.4386469423770904,Negative

"Mind
Mind
Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
Everything I do
The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace
I wanna make 'em scared
Like I could be anywhere
Like I'm reckless
I lost my mind
I don't mind
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
(Bellyache, bellyache, bellyache)

Maybe it's in the gutter

"Billie Eilish - “bellyache” lyrics:

sitting all alone
mouth full of gum
in the driveway 

my friends aren’t far
in the back of my car
lay their bodies

where’s my mind
where’s my mind

it’ll be pretty soon
looking through my room
for the money

biting my nails
i’m too young to go to jail
it’s kinda funny

where’s my mind 
where’s my mind
where’s my mind
where’s my mind

maybe it’s in the gutter
where I left my lover 
what an expensive fate

my “v” is for vendetta
i thought that i’d feel better
but now i got a bellyache

everything i do
the way i wear my noose
like a necklace 

i want to make them scared
like i could be anywhere
like i’m reckless

i lost my mind
i don’t mind
where’s my mind
where’s my mind

maybe it’s in the gutter
where i left my lover
what an expensive fate

My “v” is for vendetta 
i thought that i’d feel better
But now i got a bellyache

(bellyache, bellyache, bellyache, bellyache)

maybe it’s in the gutter
where i left my lover
what an expensive fate

My “v” is for vendetta 
i thought that i’d feel better
But now i got a bellyache",0.9793,Positive,0.059375,Neutral,0.2670314908027649,Neutral

"Mind
Mind

Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies

Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny

Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

Everything I do
The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace
I wanna make 'em scared
Like I could be anywhere
Like I'm reckless

I lost my mind
I don't mind
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

"Mind
Mind

Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies

Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny

Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

Everything I do
The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace
I wanna make 'em scared
Like I could be anywhere
Like I'm reckless

I lost my mind
I don't mind
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

"When it's lovely, I believe in anything
What does love mean when the end is rolling in? (Ooh)
Let it go, let it stay
Can we love one another?
Cold, is it safe to be warm in the summer?
Who knows? (Who knows?)
I said, ""Who knows?""

Ooh, teach me to love just to let me go
I can't believe that I'm not enough
Not enough
And so long, no one will be here to save you
And no one will be here to let you know
Let you know
This is your world (this is your world)
This is your world (this is your world)

Quietly still
In a lie
Oh, goodnight
I don't mind

Ooh, teach me to love just to let me go
I can't believe that I'm not enough
Not enough
And so long, no one will be here to save you
And no one will be here to let you know (let you know)
