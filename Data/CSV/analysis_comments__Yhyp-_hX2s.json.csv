Look
If you had
One shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it
Or just let it slip?

Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better

His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows, it's all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family 'cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryna feed and water my seed, plus
Teeter totter, caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much
For me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, is my shot
Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

"Look
If you had
One shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it
Or just let it slip?

Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better

His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows, it's all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family 'cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryna feed and water my seed, plus
Teeter totter, caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much
For me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, is my shot
Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

"*WW2 like war being started to hide WW2 like genocide.  Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic, now under corona virus pandemic.* Corona means crown, and a virus attacking the crown/government is some thing exposing government (2Corinthians4:4).  *Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 can only apply to one place on earth.  Research it well to learn who has been behind slaughters for centuries!*  1John5:19 is trying to stop Daniel12:4,2:44,45.  *Hitler was an unexcommunicated Catholic, who rounded up to go to concentration camps because of a supposed typhus epidemic, and they were gassed on the way by vehicle exhaust, or by zyklon B rodent extermination gas(h#$%@3n)cyanide. Just like Hitler started a World War to hide the genocide, so are they now.*  NATO militerizing Ukraine. *NATO changed the capital of Ukraine from a Russian word to a new name.  The West overthrew the Russian backed government less than 10 years ago and has been killing those still loyal to Russia and calling them separatists or Russian sympathizers.* There were massive quantities of UK/US rockets and rocket launchers, which regular Catholic Ukrainians use to destroy Russian military vehicles.  *NATO calls Russia stupid for having all there tanks in a row, but they were coming in to defend, but the leader(an actor), Nazi sympathizer, is either ignorant or planned the attack.*  Does any one remember World War Two?  Same happening. *Trump said 2 years ago,""We'll soon be at war with Russia and China"". The virus disappeared, because they couldn't explain new vaccines for new variants with out testing.  To get a vaccine in a short time would be a miracle, but 30 miracles in a row?  The virus wasn't able to lock you down and control you, so they are starting WW3.  Why did virus lockdown include only being able to talk to family?  To hide information.* The people of Mariopul left for Catholic Poland(the land of most WW2 exterminations of the Church of Rome's enemies). Once empty, you can see on videos that buildings are being blown up like there is carpet bombing happening, but there is no missile or rocket seen in the sky.  NATO invents the idea that Russia has supersonic missiles that go faster than you can see.  Why would Russia use such advanced weapons to destroy low value buildings?  The explosions were too big for mortar fire and in very close timing, like a controlled demolition.  *Meanwhile all the Catholics are safe in Poland, accept the civilians who stayed to use the NATO rocket launchers in surprise attack against an unsuspecting Russian column, there to protect Russian people. Military strategists say Russia was stupid and clumsy, how they just casually drove in.  That was because they weren't attacking until they were attacked by thousands of handheld missiles.  Russian media was blocked in NATO Countries(why?).  If you have the truth, there is no reason to run from information.  RT(Chinese CGTN also), was one of the Russian sources blocked.*  There was a world wide confiscation of Russian people's assets being confiscated. Russia had been asking for talks and security guarantees, but Joe said basically (@)U.  This is the same as during WW2. *You can not let the Church that rides the Roman Empire of Revelation Apocalypse 17,18, destroy Acts2:44(communism). *Most picked up for isolation, were dead with in 70 days.*  Revelation says, *leave the Revelation18:4 group if they don't want to receive her plagues.  (Hello, if you don't want to receive her plagues!)* 
‚ÄãAccording to Revelation 18 this group wears *scarlet(Catholic Cardinals),* and *purple(Catholic Bishops).*  It refers to a city Kingdom *(Rome is the only city kingdom in the world), that rules over the Kings of the earth.*  Where are the Kings?  *The Roman Empire broke in 2 and from those 2 divisions came 10 Countries.  The Pope was the eleventh, but he got rid of 3, and from the 7 he is chosen, and there will be 10 again.*  5 Countries on each leg of the Roman Empire. *The (cross or X) is on the shields(British flag, same as Roman shield) symbolizes the ten Kingdoms(X in Latin=10), and their religious beliefs. According to official writings no one may buy or sell or say a greeting to any one who has left the cross.  The X or cross originates from the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet the tau, which means a mark, both literal and figurative.  In The Bible book of Ezekiel 9, God put a tau(mark) on the people, and it was not for salvation.  Revelation/Apocalypse **13:18** says you won't be able to buy or sell with out the tau(mark) of the beast(Empire).*  Knowingly accepting this falsehood gets you condemned. *Popes have always had a mitre(triple tiered crown) with 666 on it in Latin (Vicarivs Filli Dei).* Latin letters have a number associated with it. 1John5:19 attacking (Daniel12:4)  *Clear your browser history and cache, and YouTube search and viewing history!* Please pray for me and you!  *Study Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 deeply, as people are putting their life on the line for you!*  **There is an unclaimed open offer of 1000 000 dollars to any one who can prove that Rome(Pope) is not the man in the Temple that rides the Roman Empire of Revelation 17,18.  In fact, that is why it is called the ""Roman""Catholic Church.*  Idols on Ste. Peter's Basilica(Rome), show that Rome is a complete fraud (Acts15, Exodus20, Deuteronomy 5). *Governments mandate vaccines all over the world, which causes sabotage, boycotts, protests, walk outs and people quittng, so as to destroy businesses.*  Those trying to Daniel12:4 about 1John5:19. *The Pope and the British Royals were found guilty of genocide, by the International Criminal Court, pre corona. Donald J. Trump attacked the International Criminal Court by the US financial system.* Revelation/Apocalypse17,18, 1John5:19, 2Corinthians4:4 is waring against God and humanity. *Not NWO Daniel 12:4, but 1John**5:19** OWO. Same as the genocide and war of WW2, and plague of 1918.*  Think! *Copy and share this information!(video record, record in audio, text, or ?*  They are attacking because of information exposing them. **There are two realities playing out.**  *1.* A corona virus pandemic and a vaccine to stop its spread.  *2.* Corona means crown(government) and there is a virus(information exposing/attacking the crown/government) and there is a computer/device anti virus(vaccine)(which is supposed to protect from malicious computer code) and this anti virus deletes information from your view.(turn off antivirus software!) *Trade your digital vaccine pass for a paper one and they lose control!  Do it!  They will go in to a frenzy because of this information.*  UK just passing laws to lock people up indefinitely, with no trial, take your kids, force tests, and send to concentration camps. *UK has released tender for businesses to contract cadaver services for millions of human corpses.  Mass emergency poison purchase in Australia.  Hitler used rat poison.* Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 ruled the world for 1260 years , as Bible foretold. Rome was beheading for observing the real Sabbath(not ((Sun)day) ""lord's day"" lord's day is a clever imposter of the Sabbath.) *Catholic Austrian Royals ruled Germany and Catholic Austrian Adolf Hitler authorized most exterminations, which were in Catholic Poland, which is now completely militarizing.  Revelation/Apocalypse17,18 eats it's children.  *√ó√óEvery one needs a 2.5 micron air quality monitor, so you can see when you are being GASSED!xx*(Revelation13:15,18:5,*6*.)  *G7 nations are removing corona restrictions, to regain it by war powers, or a new bird flu plan.* G(7) of Revelation. Who will do the will of God? (*Revelation 18:6*) *Think about sabotaging NATO assets for sake of the world.  They are using hand held rocket launchers, so do the same.  Quit British Pound and US dollar, use Bitcoin or other!*  I've been warning for over two years that Rome would start a war with Russia and China to hide genocide.  *Roman Catholic Joe Biden attacking Acts2:44,45, Daniel2:44,45*  Gog and Magog are in Turkey, not Russia.  *Rome hates (Acts2:44,45; 4:32-35).*  Ukraine sinking their own ships and blowing up their own bridges.  *NATO has M.O.B. on flag, and goal is war on Acts2:44.* Rome planned Ukraine war for 2017(Pompeo).  *The Pope is the man of sin in the(false)temple with 666, and exterminating for generations, yet the US although it has the largest military, is naked and prostrated gratifying her Papal master, while UK readies her turn.  The world was counting on you.  Most cowardly in all history Ukraine war was started from Poland?(Italian/US forces were there) Who will obey God's Revelation18:4-8?  *I am not Russian.*  Fact finding mission finds Russia not guilty of genocide. Multi Nation Joint forces operation in Ukraine is Rome(since 2014).  *Ukrainian Azov Battalion (Nazis) killing those with out blue arm bands. Rome is staging the entire Ukraine scenario. *This is a take over of Ukraine/war on Russia, by Rome.*  Imagine NATO Countries attacking your Country and blaming yours, so as to attack you!  *All Countries of the world formally ask NATO Nations almost 900 military bases to leave your Countries or confiscate it, for war crimes in Ukraine, Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq(ask Scott Ritter about Iraq!) etc etc etc!*  This is a global tyrannical occupation. Christian media falsely announced that Russia invaded Ukraine, to start the war and later falsely announced that China invaded Taiwan. The war was planned as a massive NATO weapons cache found in Ukraine. NATO=Rome's military.  British forces about to blow up evidence of NATO massive weapons cache in Ukraine?  NATO might attack the Solomon Islands if they militarize, but NATO militarized Ukraine as cache's prove.  All non NATO nations may war against NATO if they declare war, using their own doctrine.

"Look
If you had
One shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it
Or just let it slip?

Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better

His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows, it's all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family 'cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryna feed and water my seed, plus
Teeter totter, caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much
For me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, is my shot
Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment

"For me, it's the best sound of all time: Eminem takes us through his distress (he's poor, has to raise and feed his daughter) but also through his aggressiveness, his desire to succeed in music. I think it's the most successful song in the history of rap with its message of perseverance. And it paid off with him.

To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, is my shot
Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

"Look
If you had
One shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it
Or just let it slip?

Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better

His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows, it's all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family 'cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryna feed and water my seed, plus
Teeter totter, caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much
For me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, is my shot
Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go

"Look
If you had
One shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it
Or just let it slip?

Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better

His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows, it's all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family 'cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryna feed and water my seed, plus
Teeter totter, caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much
For me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, is my shot
Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

"Society matters no matter what Eminem or anyone says. The reason the song was necessary because those that have no fear... Walk with a limp, don't criticize.... Society matters. World war 3 matters. I don't give up easy. I can throw up and still lead people, that's what society is about. That's why when people speak up against injustice but people trust them, it all works out. Society will prevail. With or without us 'Stars'. 

I respect kyrie because he told me the earth was flat. I don't need a vaccine. Let me catch a disease they ask if I care? No. I don't take criticism well, I wanna smoke weed in the morning to feel happy, then change clothes and take humility and deal with I gotta do. I'm a premodanna too. Success is my only option so I can help me.

"Look
If you had
One shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it
Or just let it slip?

Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better

His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows, it's all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family 'cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryna feed and water my seed, plus
Teeter totter, caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much
For me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, is my shot
Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better
