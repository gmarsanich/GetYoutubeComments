"When I get blocked on something I use wheels of different options and permutation, basically play with the combinations of phrases or objects. 

Its a associative game basically, see what connections I can make. When something clicks I jot it down, occasionally these jots create a whole story or something together and sometimes ONE combination explodes into somethings. The key is to treat it as much like a game as possible!

This is very dynamic and not at all restrictive to the pieces on the wheel even if they are few. The mind has technically indefinite extensions for any specific ""item"" as the concrete approachs the abstract and back again...

One can also have a bit of weed and try this. When I do that: I prefer edibles because you can control the dose to figure out what goes best for this exercise, eat them with some fat for better absorption and start the exercise abt 20 to 30 minutes before it usually kicks in for you. Enough time to get situated and your efforts started, maybe even in a particular direction and let the weed effect come in and loosen you up a bit in stages. (Goal is to do something between microdosing and being ""high for fun"", so adjust mg dose accordingly)      

IF there are further issues trying this:
When the issue is more mental flexibility, then I meditate using mindfulness. If its concentration, then mantra.

If you couldn't tell from my name, I am a bit out there, but:
Someone can adapt these basic principles to a secular mindset if they wish with little problem and have a three part mental hygenic toolkit that will last your lifetime.

Ultimately, ""content creators"", and workers of all kinds are people too and self-care is incredibly important for lifetime sustainable work and personal development.",0.9328,Positive,0.0557378472222222,Neutral,0.4044647216796875,Positive

"Video idea: Powerpuff girls but all the villains are hungry cannibals. The leader would be Mojo-Jojo but as a literal monkey that lost his speaking intellect because of all the humans he already ate. The powerpuff girls reveal that they're there to save the Professor, but the red gay lobster thing appears from the shadows to show professor with only half his torso left and bleeding to death, asking the girls to save theirselves. Mojo-Jojo eerily screams and pulls out one of the professors legs to ravagely eat to intimidate the girls. The girls, enraged, decide to turn off their pacifist filters in sight of such atrocity, killing the entire city because of the viral cannibalism. The president turned into Nikocado avocado and they kill him last. Bubbles, bringing along the Professors dead body thats already rotting and full of maggots and flies is flewn into the scene on the broading overview of the city from the Mayors office to show that they did it. Killed every Cannibal. They're drenched in blood and bubbles maniacally laughs. Sitting down in peace, they realize they already commited mass genocide. That theyre no different. Buttercup asked to them why everyone turned into a cannibal. The scene slowly pans to the ither two sisters with bloodshot red eyes now eating the professors. They started it all along. They were the original cannibals.",-0.9867,Negative,0.0040849673202614,Neutral,-0.264640063047409,Negative
