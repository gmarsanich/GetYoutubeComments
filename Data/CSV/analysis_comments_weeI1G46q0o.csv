We the Best Music
Another one!
DJ Khaled

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber & DJ Khaled]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth
The money never lie, no
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Early mornin' in the Dawn
Know you wanna ride now (Let's ride, let's ride!)
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah
And you sick of all those other imitators
Don't let the only real one intimidate ya
See you watchin', don't run outta time now
I'm the one, yeah

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Quavo]
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the only one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the only one
Yeah, yeah!
[Verse 1: Quavo]
Quavo! I'm the one that hit that same spot (Hit it)
She the one that bring them rain drops (Rain drops)
We go back, remember criss-cross and hopscotch? (Hopscotch)
You the one that hold me down when the block's hot (Hot)
I make your dreams come true when you wake up (Dream)
And your look's just the same without no make-up (Bad)
Had to pull up on your mama, see what you're made of (Mama)
Ain't gotta worry 'bout 'em commas 'cause my cake up (Cake)
You can run inside my life from that fame bus (Skrrt)
'Cause I promise, when we step out you'll be famous (Yeah)
Modern day Bonnie and Clyde what they named us (Why?)
'Cause when we pull up—brt-brt!—all angles

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber & DJ Khaled]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth
The money never lie, no
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Early mornin' in the Dawn
Know you wanna ride now (Let's ride, let's ride!)
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah
And you sick of all those other imitators
Don't let the only real one intimidate ya
See you watchin', don't run outta time now
I'm the one, yeah
Chorus: Justin Bieber & Chance The Rapper]
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the only one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the only one
Okay though

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Uh, she beat her face up with that new Chanel
She like the price, she see the ice, it make her coochie melt
When I met her in the club I asked her who she felt
Then she went and put that booty on that Gucci belt
We don't got no label
She say she want bottles, she ain't got no table
She don't got no bed frame, she don't got no tables
We just watchin' Netflix, she ain't got no cable, okay though
Plug, plug, plug, I'm the plug for her
She want a nigga that pull her hair and hold the door for her
Baby, that's only me, bitch, it okay with me
Baby, okay, okay though

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber & DJ Khaled]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth
The money never lie, no
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Early mornin' in the Dawn
Know you wanna ride now (Let's ride, let's ride!)
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah
And you sick of all those other imitators
Don't let the only real one intimidate ya
See you watchin', don't run outta time now
I'm the one, yeah
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the only one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the only one

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Lookin' for the one?
Well, bitch, you're lookin' at the one
I'm the best yet, and yet my best is yet to come
'Cause I've been lookin' for somebody
Not just any fuckin' body
Don't make me catch a body
That's for any and everybody
Oh my God, she hit me up all day, get no response
Bitch, you blow my high
That's like turnin' gold to bronze, roll my eyes
And when she on the molly, she a zombie
She think we Clyde and Bonnie
But it's more like Whitney and Bobby
God, forgive me! Tunechi F finessin', I'm a legend
Straight up out the Crescent
Fly your bae down for the Essence
For the record I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records
Mula Gang, winnin' record
I'm just flexin' on my exes, oh God

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber & DJ Khaled]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth
The money never lie, no
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Early mornin' in the Dawn
Know you wanna ride now (Let's ride, let's ride!)
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah
And you sick of all those other imitators
Don't let the only real one intimidate ya
See you watchin', don't run outta time now
I'm the one, yeah

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the only one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the only one

Yeah, you're sick of all those other imitators
Don't let the only real one intimidate you
See you watchin', don't run outta time now
I'm the one, yeah

Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, oh-eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, oh-eh-oh
I'm the only one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, oh-eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, oh-eh-oh
I'm the only one
Okay though

Uh, she beat her face up with that new Chanel
She like the price, she see the ice, it make her coochie melt
When I met her in the club I asked her who she felt
Then she went and put that booty on that Gucci belt
We don't got no label
She say she want bottles, she ain't got no table
She don't got no bed frame, she don't got no tables
We just watchin' Netflix, she ain't got no cable, okay though
Plug, plug, plug, I'm the plug for her
She want a nigga that pull her hair and hold the door for her
Baby, that's only me, bitch, it okay with me
Baby, okay, okay though

Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth, the money never lie no
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Early mornin' in the dawn, know you wanna ride now (let's ride)
I'm the one, yeah (let's ride), I'm the one, yeah
Yeah, you're sick of all those other imitators
Don't let the only real one intimidate you
See you watchin', don't run outta time now
I'm the one, yeah

Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, oh-eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, oh-eh-oh
I'm the only one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, oh-eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, oh-eh-oh
I'm the only one

Lookin' for the one? Well, bitch, you're looking at the one
I'm the best yet, and yet, my best is yet to come
'Cause I've been lookin' for somebody, not just any fuckin' body
Don't make me catch a body, that's for any and everybody
Oh my God, she hit me up all day, get no response
Bitch, you blow my high, that's like turnin' gold to bronze
Roll my eyes
And when she on the molly, she a zombie
She think we Clyde and Bonnie, but it's more like Whitney and Bobby
God forgive me
Tunechi F, finessin', I'm a legend
Straight up out The Crescent, fly your bae down for the Essence
For the record I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records
Mula Gang, winnin' record, I'm just flexin' on my exes, oh God

Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth, the money never lie no
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Early mornin' in the dawn, know you wanna ride now (let's ride)
I'm the one, yeah (let's ride), I'm the one, yeah
Yeah, you're sick of all those other imitators
Don't let the only real one intimidate you
See you watchin', don't run outta time now
I'm the one, yeah

Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, oh-eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, oh-eh-oh
I'm the only one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, oh-eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, oh-eh-oh
I'm the only one

Don't you know girl, don't you know girl
I am the one for you (I'm the one) yeah I'm the one
Don't you know girl, don't you know girl
I am the one for you (I'm the one) yeah I'm the one
Don't you know girl, don't you know girl
I am the one for you (I'm the one) yeah I'm the one

Quavo
I'm the one that hit that same spot (hit it)
She the one that bring them rain drops (rain drops)
We go back, remember criss-cross and hopscotch? (hopscotch)
You the one that hold me down when the block's hot (hot)
I make your dreams come true when you wake up (dream)
And your look's just the same without no make-up
Had to pull up on your mama, see what you're made of (mama)
Ain't gotta worry 'bout 'em commas 'cause my cake up (cake)
You can run inside my life on that fame bus (skrr)
'Cause I promise when we step out you'll be famous (yeah)
Modern day Bonnie and Clyde what they named us (why?)
'Cause when we pull up (prr, prr) all angles

Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth, the money never lie no
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Early mornin' in the dawn, know you wanna ride now (let's ride)

Lookin' for the one? Well, bitch, you're looking at the one
I'm the best yet, and yet, my best is yet to come
'Cause I've been lookin' for somebody, not just any fuckin' body
Don't make me catch a body, that's for any and everybody
Oh my God, she hit me up all day, get no response
Bitch, you blow my high, that's like turnin' gold to bronze
Roll my eyes
And when she on the molly, she a zombie
She think we Clyde and Bonnie, but it's more like Whitney and Bobby
God forgive me
Tunechi F, finessin', I'm a legend
Straight up out The Crescent, fly your bae down for the Essence
For the record I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records
Mula Gang, winnin' record, I'm just flexin' on my exes, oh God

Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth, the money never lie no
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Early mornin' in the dawn, know you wanna ride now (let's ride)
I'm the one, yeah (let's ride), I'm the one, yeah
Yeah, you're sick of all those other imitators
Don't let the only real one intimidate you
See you watchin', don't run outta time now
I'm the one, yeah

Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, oh-eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, oh-eh-oh
I'm the only one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, oh-eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, oh-eh-oh
I'm the only one

Don't you know girl, don't you know girl
I am the one for you (I'm the one) yeah I'm the one
Don't you know girl, don't you know girl
I am the one for you (I'm the one) yeah I'm the one
Don't you know girl, don't you know girl

"Do you consider yourself to be a good person? Most people do. However, most of us differ as to the definition of ""good."" The Bible says that God is good, and the Ten Commandments are His standard of goodness. So, we will look at God's Law . . . With a tender conscience, ask yourself if you have obeyed the following: 

1. You shall have no other gods before Me. (Have you always loved God above all else?)
2. You shall not make yourself an idol. (Have you made a god in your mind that you're more comfortable with, a god to suit yourself?)
3. You shall not take God's name in vain. (Have you ever used God's holy Name as a cuss word?)
4. Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy.
5. Honor your father and mother.
6. You shall not murder. (God considers hatred to be as murder).
7. You shall not commit adultery. (""Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart"" Matthew 5:27-28; this also includes sex before marriage).
8. You shall not steal. (Have you ever stolen anything? the value of the item is irrelevant).
9. You shall not lie. (Have you lied even once? Including answering these questions).
10. You shall not covet. (Have you ever jealously desired what belongs to others?)
The Bible says that God will punish all murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, adulterers, etc. He will even judge our words and thoughts. On Judgment Day, will you be found to be guilty or innocent of breaking His commandments? 

Perhaps you think that God is good, and will therefore overlook your sins. But it is His goodness that will make sure that murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, etc. receive justice. He would be a corrupt Judge if He turned a blind eye to injustice. Have you kept the Commandments? 

The Bible says that the Law is perfect. It commands you to be perfect (Matthew 5:48). Are you perfect (in thought, word, and deed)? Will you make it to Heaven? You may say that you are still good, but God says you're not (see Psalm 14:2-3). So one of you is lying, and the Scriptures tell us that it is impossible for God to lie. Remember that all liars will be cast into the Lake of Fire (Revelation 21:8). God's Law demands justice, and the penalty for sinning against Him is death and Hell. Listen carefully if you want to live. 

God Himself made a way where His justice and His goodness could meet. We broke the Law, but He became a man to pay the fine. Jesus suffered and died on the cross to satisfy the Law. God can forgive us and grant us the gift of everlasting life! But you may still think that you can (from now on) keep the Ten Commandments. But isn't it true that the best of us have lied, stolen, lusted, hated, failed to love God above all else, and failed to love our neighbor as ourselves? 

How can we then, live a ""good"" life if we have already sinned against God? At best we are reformed liars and thieves . . . but still Lawbreakers. Think of it this way - would you sell one of your eyes for a million dollars? Would you sell both for $50 million? I'm sure you wouldn't. Your eyes are priceless, yet they are merely the windows of your soul. What then must your life (soul) be worth? With these thoughts in mind, what would be a fair price to pay for everlasting life? It is utterly without price. Yet, if we trust in our own goodness to enter Heaven, we are saying to God, ""I should enter Heaven because I have done good - I have earned my way in."" 

Imagine if you wanted to give me a brand new (very expensive) car, but I said, ""I can't take it! I feel embarrassed receiving such a gift . . . here's 10 cents for it."" I'm sure you would be very insulted by such a pathetic offer of payment. Besides, if I pay for it, it is no longer a gift, it's a purchase . . . it's mine by right. 

When we talk of entering Heaven by being good, by trying to keep the Ten Commandments etc., we are tossing God 10 cents of ""self-righteousness,"" which is a terrible insult to Him, in the light of His sacrifice. The only thing we can do is humble ourselves, repent of our sins, and receive the gift by trusting Jesus Christ alone. Almighty God demonstrated how much He loves you when Jesus suffered for you on the cross. If you want to trust in your own goodness, then you are saying His agonizing death on the cross was in vain. The Bible says, ""For by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God."" You cannot earn a gift. 

When Jesus said to ""believe"" on Him, He was saying we should have faith in Him, in the same way you would trust a parachute to save you when you jump from a plane. You don't merely believe in the parachute - you put it on. Please don't ""jump"" without Jesus. If you die in your sins there is no second chance. God will give you justice, and you will end up in Hell forever. Any troubles you have at present are dwarfed by the trouble you are in with your Creator. His wrath abides upon you (John 3:36). God doesn't want you to go to Hell. Neither do you want to go there, so confess your sins to God right now, put your trust in Jesus to save you, and you will pass from death to life. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. (See John 14:21). Your obedience to God is the proof of your love. Have faith in God, He will never fail you. 

Pray something like this: 

""Dear God, today I turn away from all of my sins (name them). This day I put my trust in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. He is the only way for me to be saved. He is 'The way, the truth, and the life.'"" Please forgive me, change my heart, and grant me Your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.""",0.9982,Positive,0.1802664867599932,Positive,0.3337999582290649,Positive

"*WW2 like war being started to hide WW2 like genocide.  Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and now ​a corona virus pandemic. Corona means crown, and a virus attacking the crown/government is some thing exposing government (2Corinthians4:4).  Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 can only apply to one place on earth.  Research it well to learn who has been behind slaughters for centuries!*   1John5:19 is trying to stop Daniel12:4,2:44,45.  Hitler was an unexcommunicated Catholic.  Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 is orchestrating this assault against humanity, but they are trying to blame it on innocent peoples, Countries and groups.  *Hitler rounded up to go to concentration camps because of a supposed typhus epidemic, and were gassed on the way by vehicle exhaust, or by zyklon B rodent extermination gas.* (h#$%@3n)cyanide.  *Most were dead with in 70 days of being picked up.*  Canada shut down a government minister on a Parliamentary broadcast for inquiring about their concentration camps. 
*Revelation mentions that people should leave the Revelation18:4 group if they don't want to receive her plagues.  (Hello, if you don't want to receive her plagues!)* 
​According to Revelation 18 this group wears *scarlet(Cardinals),* and *purple(Bishops).*  It refers to a city Kingdom (Rome is the only city kingdom in the world), that rules over the Kings of the earth.  Where are the Kings?  The Roman Empire broke in 2 and from those 2 divisions came 10 Countries.  The Pope was the eleventh, but he got rid of 3, and from the 7 he is chosen, and there will be 10 again.  5 Countries on each leg of the Roman Empire.  The (cross or X) is on the shields(British flag, same as Roman shield) of the the Empire, and it symbolizes the ten Kingdoms, and the religious beliefs. According to official writings no one may buy or sell or say a greeting to any one who has left the cross.  The X or cross originates from the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet the tau, which means a mark, both literal and figurative.  In The Bible book of Ezekiel 9, God put a tau(mark) on the people who were crying over the loss of wickedness.  The mark was not for salvation.  Revelation/Apocalypse 13:18 says you won't be able to buy or sell with out the tau(mark) of the beast(Empire).  It is 1 of only 2 things that the Bible says gets you condemned, with no chance of repenting and being forgiven. The cross has been used through out history, including the Egyptians called it the ankh, which was a symbol of power.  The cross has falsely become associated with the Messiah(Christ), and that is where Xmass, and Christmas comes from.  Popes have always had a mitre(triple tiered crown) with 666 on it in Latin (Vicarivs Filli Dei). 
​Latin letters have a number associated with it(like a Roman clock), just like Hebrew and Greek.   Rome has called for mass destruction and sabotage to stop people from hearing this.  Government and Churches working in self interest. The earth belongs to the people collectively.  *1John**5:19** is getting people to attack the people trying to make you free.(Daniel12:4)  *Clear your browser history and cache, and YouTube search and viewing history!  Please pray for me and you!*  Their hate for Acts2:44 runs deep, and that is why Christian nations are committing genocide under the guise of a corona virus, just as Hitler did under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and falsely attacking China. *The last war China fought was WW2, and that was because they were attacked.*  Try reading your Bible and having a scrap of decency!  Study Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 deeply, as people are putting their life on the line for you!  **There is an open offer of 1000 000 dollars to any one who can prove that Rome(Pope) is not the man in the Temple that rides the Roman Empire of Revelation 17,18.  In fact, that is why it is called the ""Roman""Catholic Church.**  Idols on Ste. Peter's Basilica(Rome), show that Rome is a complete fraud (Acts15, Exodus20, Deuteronomy 5).   Revelation17,18 is framing innocent people and businesses, and are going to attempt to get people so mad they will kill their perceived enemies. Governments issue vaccine mandates all over the world.   Businesses face huge fines if they don't comply, but Revelation17,18 causes sabotage, boycotts, protests, walk outs and people quittng, so as to destroy business.  Those trying to Daniel12:4 about 1John5:19. *The Pope and the British Royals were found guilty of genocide, by the International Criminal Court, pre corona. Donald J. Trump attacked the International Criminal Court by the US financial system. (corrupt), and now trying to start war with Russia.*  Revelation/Apocalypse17,18, 1John5:19, 2Corinthians4:4 is waring against God and humanity. Not NWO Daniel 12:4, but 1John5:19 OWO.*  Same as the genocide and war of WW2, and plague of 1918?  *Think! Copy and share this information!(video record, record in audio, text, or ?*  All the things happening are to hide a Hitler like genocide.  They are attacking because of information exposing them.  ***There is two realities playing out.***  *1.* A corona virus pandemic and a vaccine to stop its spread.  *2.* Corona means crown(government) and there is a virus(information exposing/attacking the crown/government) and there is a computer/device anti virus(vaccine)(which is supposed to protect from malicious computer code) and this anti virus deletes information from your view.  *Trade your digital vaccine pass for a paper one and they lose control!  *Do it!*   They will go in to a frenzy because of this information.*  UK just passing laws to lock people up indefinitely, with no trial, take your kids, force tests, and send to concentration camps. UK has released tender for businesses to contract cadaver services for millions of human corpses.  Mass emergency poison purchase in Australia.  Hitler killed with odorless rat poison. Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 ruled the world for 1260 years. Rome was beheading for observing the real Sabbath(not ((Sun)day) ""lord's day"" lord's day is a clever imposter of the Sabbath.) *A Pope struck a coin commemorating chopping off people's heads for observing the Sabbath.  On one side of the coin was the Pope's head, and the other an Angel with a sword and a pile of heads.  Ste Bartholomew's eve massacre. In the Vatican library is the proof of the collaboration of Church and State enslavement. Urgent necessity, to make the Vatican library completely public, and every nation should vote to make all religious files over 100 years old public, or start paying taxes.*  Through history the Catholic Austrian Royals ruled Germany and the leader of the exterminations was Catholic Austrian Adolf Hitler, and most exterminations were in Catholic Poland, which is now completely militarizing including school children, and German troops are moving near Russia..  Revelation/Apocalypse17,18 eats it's children.  Determining the future by movies, is pure stupidity.  *××Every one needs a 2.5 micron air quality monitor, so you can see when you are being GASSED!xx* (Revelation13:15,18:5,*6*.)   *How could there be a vaccine for a new variant with out testing, that is not covered by previous jabs?*  G7 nations are removing corona restrictions, to regain it by war powers.*G(7) of Revelation.* Who will do the will of God? (*Revelation 18:6*)   *I've been warning for over two years that Rome would start a war with Russia and China to hide genocide.*  Roman Catholic Joe Biden stopped the natural gas pipeline in the US and now in Europe.  This is Rome's war.  *China be on guard of forces invading Taiwan, blaming you and attacking from there.*  Those attacking Russia/China, read Acts2:44,45, Daniel2:44,45, you follow Satan.  *Gog and Magog are in Turkey, Ezekiel38 not Russia.*  Mark of beast(MOB) nations hate (Bible Acts2:44,45; 4:32-35).  Ukraine sinking their own ships and blowing up their own bridges.  NATO has M.O.B. on flag, and goal is war on Acts2:44. *Pompeo says Rome planned Ukraine war for 2017.* Britian's Boris Johnson said, the pandemic is not working, so plan A, war.  Roman Christian militias killing in Ukraine.  *Putin wanted to talk before this happened. Think!*  Germany forbidden to cause genocide because of WW2 extermination, so now they turn their military over to NATO to do it, and mobilizing in Lithuania, according to German media.  *Russian news channels are being blocked in the West, to hide the truth. Free? No, duped.  Think!*  The Pope is the man of sin in the(false)temple with 666, and exterminating for generations, yet the *US although it has the largest military, is naked and prostrated gratifying her Papal master, while UK readies her turn.  Most cowardly in all history.*  I think Ukraine war was started from Poland as the Italian air force was there.  Who will obey God's Revelation18:4-8?  *I am not Russian.* So quit attacking Russia!  Canadian, US and British military found dead in Ukraine, from their involvement(many there for months). Poland the site of most WW2 exterminations is mobilizing the entire nation including school children for war, and Italian military is there.  *Roman Catholic Joe Biden says if this message doesn't stop, he'll attack Russia.  I'm not Russian.*  By the way, Ukraine's capital is a Russian word.  Boris ""Plan A"". *I helped build America up, so listen!  Rome is plotting your destruction.  She has false prophets claiming you are Babylon the Great, and not her.*  Russia didn't start it.  Why is Russia media being blocked? Corona virus disappears and British/Rome ""Plan A"" appears. Russian Ukraine are like brothers.  Rome's staging of the war is the only way to make sense of it.  NATO has the MOB on their flag and militarizing Ukraine long before the war and their goal is to destroy the Bible's Acts2:44(Russia).  Every nation should pray about helping Russia!   Decent people boycott G7!  US committed war crimes in Afghanistan, should we boycott ourselves? +((?",-0.9998,Negative,-0.002764472875859,Negative,-0.3023847043514251,Negative

And your look's just the same without no make-up
Had to pull up on your mama, see what you're made of (mama)
Ain't gotta worry 'bout 'em commas 'cause my cake up (cake)
