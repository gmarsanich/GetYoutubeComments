"the fish game i actually loved bc it didnt rely on cheap shitty jumpscares like most other ""horror"" games. It was ACTUALLY horrifying and i appreciate that. It was like a breath of fresh...fishy..air

"You know I always hated hearing, ""Don't worry, a lot of people are going through the same thing. You're not alone."" There's this selfish barbed wire inside my chest that coils up at that. ""No, my pain is more tragic. Grander! Deeper! If only you knew!"" That's not true of course, I hate talking about it. Because I hate people who talk about it. And that's not very nice, that's not okay, that's not how you can be about all this. It's not romantic, but at least it's true. Don't worry, a lot of people are going through the same thing. And that's what makes it the best USP yet. Can anything beat home cooking straight off the conveyor belt? These fish are so fresh they much just give you a little wink and jump right off the plate into your mouth!

"I  think the second game 'Dark Dreams' could have a lot of potential.

If I understood correctly, you play as the mentally ill husband. You torment your family without realizing it, because you see them as ""monsters"".
At the complete end I think there are kind of two basic endings:
'The BAD end'- You succumb to your illness and never get out of it, living in fear and your family probably leaves you as well.
'The GOOD end'- You realize that you're the ""monster"" and get help. That gives the 'fixed home and you being happy with your family' picture with the end titles going on screen.

This is all just an assumption and I think if they ever finish the game, it could be a really cool and fun playthrough!",0.8673,Positive,0.0583333333333333,Positive,0.4361341595649719,Positive

"For people who don't know what the backrooms are -




You basically noclip out of the world. The first room is the yellow room. It's relatively supposed to be safe; But unsettling. The end is where you encounter a beast in which I believe you either can't look at it or you'll die or you have to look at it. There are what I think are five rooms in total. Maybe less maybe more. I believe it was said that no one has fully ""escaped"" so it's unclear how many in total. There another level with florescent lights that flicker. When it's dark there are monsters that aren't inherently aggressive; But will kill you if tempted. I think there might also be a level in which you have something that is inherently aggressive.

"Thanks, Markiplier, for helping me with my sensory overload issue. I used to have a really hard time with jumpscares, getting legitimately stressed out during scary movies (though still kind of liking to watch them anyway, just not too often)

Since becoming a fan of Mark's scary games stuff, I've gotten better at handling scary stuff in general. I have more fun with horror because of you, dude. Just thought you might appreciate knowing that",-0.2862,Negative,0.0734848484848484,Positive,0.4558647572994232,Positive

"28:10 ""Blood is thicker than water"" _is_ the full phrase. It traces back to a 12th century epic called _Reinhart Fuchs,_ with the more familiar form of ""Blood is thicker than water"" tracing to the 1600's. The longer phrase is a modern one that traces as far back as the 90's, to a man named Richard Pustelniak.

If you prefer the modern phrase that's perfectly fine, just because something is older doesn't mean it's better.",0.5565,Positive,0.1996794871794871,Positive,0.3587946593761444,Positive
