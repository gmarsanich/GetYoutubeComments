"Yo puedo ver un mundo ideal 
Que me espera sin dudar 
Y lo llamo hogar 
Por la oscuridad 
donde nadie habit√≥
Pero es mi hogar 
Dicen que dicen que 
Es un poco loco 
Dicen que dicen que 
Perdi la noci√≥n 
No me importa que digan 
Que yo estoy loco
Es posible vivir lo que so√±as 
Cuando me voy a dormir
Colores llegan hacia mi 
Mil sue√±os me despiertan sin parar 
Pienso en un mundo que 
Seria como imagine 
Mil sue√±os es lo que me va a costar
Mil sue√±os que juntos vamos a alcanzar

UN HOGAR CONSTRUIR
MIL HABITACIONES Y 
COSAS NUEVAS TRAER 
DARTE LO MAS ESPECIAL 
Y SE QUE SONREIRAS
AUNQUE OSCURO ESTE

Y DIRAN Y DIRAN QUE ESTO SUENA LOCO
Y DIRAN QUE PERDIMOS LA RAZON 
NO ME IMPORTA QUE DIGAN QUE ESTAMOS LOCOS
HUIREMOS A UN MUNDO DE LOS DOS 

CUANDO ME VOY A DORMIR 
COLORES LLEGAN HACIA MI 
MIL SUE√ëOS ME DESPIERTAN SIN PARAR
PIENSO EN UN MUNDO QUE 
SERIA COMO IMAGINE 
MIL SUE√ëOS ES LO QUE NOS VA A COSTAR 


SEA GRANDE O NO QUISIERA SER
PARTE DEL MUNDO EN QUE ESTES 
SUE√ëA JUNTO A MI 
QUIZ√Å ESTE BIEN QUIZ√Å ESTE MAL 
CONTIGO ME VAS A LLEVAR
AL LUGAR QUE VES 
AL LUGAR QUE VEO AL SO√ëAR, AL SO√ëAR

CUANDO ME VOY A DORMIR
COLORES LLEGAN HACIA A MI 
MIL SUE√ëOS ME DESPIERTAN SIN PARAR (MIL SUE√ëOS QUE, MIL SUE√ëOS QUE)
PIENSO EN UN MUNDO QUE SERIA COMO IMAGINE 
MIL SUE√ëOS ES LO QUE NOS VA A COSTAR

"A Million Memes (Extended, original by @kairi)

I close my eyes and I can see my grades in math is 70 
Then they call my mom
Through the dark,through the door of the guidance councilor
But it feels like hell

They can say, 
They can say that I am failing...

They can say, they can say I've lost my mind...

I don't care
I don't care if I've gone crazy...
I already knew what's with my miiind.....

[Chorus]
Cuz every night I lie in bed,
The most random things fill my head,
A million memes are keeping me awake...

I think of all the things I'd be,
If memes weren't all that I'd see
A million memes is all it's gonna taaake...

Oh a million memes are what keep me awake...

[Interlood]

There's a chance,
I'd succeed,
But it's very slim indeed
To fulfill my every neeeed...

The special things
I aspire,
Wouldn't happen if I am tired...
I really need some sleep...

They can say
They can say that I am failing...
They can say, They can say my assignment's duuuueee....

I don't care, I don't care, 
Sleep don't exist to meeee...
I'll pull an all-nighter, I'll be fiiiiiinneeeeee....

[Repeat Chorus}
However big,
However small,
The memes will just ruin it all...
Stop sharing memes with meeeee.....

They may be dank,
They may be gold,
But soon they will get very old...
And the memes I see
Are distracting me from schooool again!!!
Don't wanna fail agaaaaaaiiinnnn!!!!!!

[Last chorus]
Cuz every night I lie in bed,
The most random things fill my head,
A million memes are keeping me awake...
(A million memes, THE DUMBEST MEMES!!!!)

I think of all the things I'd be,
If memes weren't all that I see,
A million memes is all it's gonna TAAAAAAKEEE!!!
A million memes are what keep me AWAAAKE- (AT 3AM!!!!!)

I close my eyes and I can see
The world that's waiting up for me
That I call my own
Through the dark, through the door
Through where no one's been before
But it feels like home

They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say I've lost my mind
I don't care, I don't care, so call me crazy
We can live in a world that we design

'Cause every night I lie in bed
The brightest colours fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
Oh a million dreams for the world we're gonna make

There's a house we can build
Every room inside is filled
With things from far away
The special things I compile
Each one there to make you smile
On a rainy day

They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say we've lost our minds
I don't care, I don't care if they call us crazy
Runaway to a world that we design

Every night I lie in bed
The brightest colours fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
Oh a million dreams for the world we're gonna make

However big, however small
Let me be part of it all
Share your dreams with me
You may be right, you may be wrong
But say that you'll bring me along
To the world you see
To the world I close my eyes to see
I close my eyes to see

Every night I lie in bed
The brightest colours fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
A million dreams, a million dreams
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make

"The paradise outside our windows
By me 

I close my and I can see a world that‚Äôs right in front of me that I call Paradise

Threw glass threw the door threw were everyone has seen but it‚Äôs like heaven

They can they can say it all sounds crazy they can say they can say I‚Äôve lost my mind I don‚Äôt care I don‚Äôt care they call me crazy 

I could be in a world better then designed 

Cause every night I lie in bed the brightest colors fill my head 

A million dreams are keeping me awake 

I think of what the world could be a vision of the world I see

A million dreams is all gonna take

Oh a million dreams for the world waiting for me to see

There‚Äôs a world right here every spot of it is filled with better then magic

"Alternate version 

I close my eyes im dead inside

I dont think i need to live 

Cause im in death row

Throught the dark through the van

Through to my own basement 

It is your new home

They can say they can say 

it all sounds crazy

They can say 

Ive lost my mind

I dont care

I dont care so call me crazy 

Cause i am a psychopath

Cause evey night i lie in bed 

the darkest colors fill my head

A million kids are keeping me awake

I think of what the world could be 

The a vision of the one i see 

A million dollars 

Is all its gonna take 

A million dollars 

For the world were gonna make

Theres a guy with cocaine

Every kid will love it

In there breakfast 

Special drugs i compile 

Each one there to make you smile 

On a glommy day 

They can say 

They can say it all sounds crazy

They can say 

They can say we've lost our minds

I dont care 

I dont care how many cops 

Runaway to a safe house

Every night i lie in bed

The darkest colors fill my head 

A million shots are keeping me awake

I think of what the world could be

A terrifying embacy

A million bribes is all its gonna

Oh a million kids 

For the world were gonna make

However big however small

Let me be part of it all

Share the kids you took 

We may survive

We may die

So i will leave you behind

To the city

To the world i drive to see

I drive to see

Cause every night i lie in bed the brightest colors fill my head

A million bucks 

Are kepping me rich

A million kids

I think of what the world could be 

A terrifying embacy

A million kids 

Is all its gonna take

A million kids

For the empire were gonna make

For the world were gonna make",-0.9746,Negative,-0.06975649350649352,Negative,-0.2664526402950287,Negative

"VLAAMSE DUB (FLEMISH DUB)
Ik sluit mijn ogen en ik zie
Een wereld die op me wacht die ik de mijne noem
Door het donker, door de deur
Door waar niemand eerder is geweest
Maar het voelt als thuis

Ze kunnen zeggen, ze kunnen zeggen dat het allemaal gek klinkt
Ze kunnen zeggen, ze kunnen zeggen dat ik mijn verstand heb verloren
Het kan me niet schelen, het kan me niet schelen, als ze me gek noemen
We kunnen leven in een wereld die wij ontwerpen

Want elke nacht als ik in bed lig
Vullen de helderste kleuren mijn hoofd
Een miljoen dromen houden me wakker
Ik denk aan wat de wereld zou kunnen zijn
Een visioen van die ene die ik zie
Een miljoen dromen is alles wat nodig is
Oh, een miljoen dromen voor de wereld die we gaan maken

Er is een huis dat we kunnen bouwen
Elke kamer binnen is gevuld met dingen van ver weg
Speciale dingen die ik bijeen breng
Elk daar om je te laten glimlachen op een regenachtige dag

Ze kunnen zeggen, ze kunnen zeggen dat het allemaal gek klinkt
Ze kunnen zeggen, ze kunnen zeggen dat we ons verstand hebben verloren
Zie je, het kan me niet schelen, het kan me niet schelen als ze ons gek noemen
Vlucht naar een wereld die wij ontwerpen

Want elke nacht als ik in bed lig
Vullen de helderste kleuren mijn hoofd
Een miljoen dromen houden me wakker
Ik denk aan wat de wereld zou kunnen zijn
Een visioen van die ene die ik zie
Een miljoen dromen is alles wat nodig is
Oh, een miljoen dromen voor de wereld die we gaan maken

Hoe groot, hoe klein ook
Laat me er deel van uitmaken
Deel je dromen met mij
We kunnen gelijk hebben, we kunnen ongelijk hebben
Maar ik wil je meenemen naar de wereld die ik zie
Voor de wereld sluiten we onze ogen om te zien
We sluiten onze ogen om te zien

Want elke nacht als ik in bed lig
Vullen de helderste kleuren mijn hoofd
Een miljoen dromen houden me wakker
Ik denk aan wat de wereld zou kunnen zijn
Een visioen van die ene die ik zie
Een miljoen dromen is alles wat nodig is
Oh, een miljoen dromen voor de wereld die we gaan maken

"Mis ojos cierro y veo all√≠ un mundo que espera por mi 
M√≠o ya ser√°
En la oscuridad donde nadie fue jam√°s 
Siento que es mi hogar 
Y dir√°n y dir√°n que suena loco
Y dir√°n que he perdido la raz√≥n
No me importa que digan que estoy loco
Crearemos un mundo t√∫ y yo 

Pues cada noche al so√±ar 
Tantos colores veo brillar 
Mil sue√±os que me hacen despertar 
Pienso que el mundo puede ser 
Algo mejor lo puedo ver 
Mil sue√±os solo necesitar√°n 
Son mil sue√±os que nuestro mundo cambiar√°n 

Un hogar construir mil habitaciones y cosas nuevas traer
Darte lo m√°s especial 
Y se que sonreir√°s 
Aunque oscuro este 
Y dir√°n y dir√°n que suena loco 
Y dir√°n que perdimos la raz√≥n 
No me importa que digan que estamos locos 
Huiremos a un mundo de los dos 

Pues cada noche al so√±ar 
Tantos colores veo brillar 
Mil sue√±os que me hacen despertar 
Pienso que el mundo puede ser 
Algo mejor lo puedo ver 
Mil sue√±os solo necesitar√°n 
Son mil sue√±os que nuestro mundo cambiar√°n 

Sea grande o no quisiera ser 
Parte del mundo en el que estes 
Sue√±a junto a mi 
Quiz√° est√© bien 
Quiz√° este mal
Contigo me vas a llevar 
Al lugar que ves 
Al lugar que veo al solar 
Que veo al so√±ar

Pues cada noche al so√±ar 
Tantos colores veo brillar 
Mil sue√±os que me hacen despertar 
Pienso que el mundo puede ser 
Algo mejor lo puedo ver 
Mil sue√±os solo necesitar√°n 
Son mil sue√±os que nuestro mundo cambiar√°n

Suffer the wrath of me!

The greatest dreams fill my head

"COVID-19 version (:

I close my eyes, and I can see,
My Netflix screen waiting for me.
'Cause I'm stuck at home.
Through the dark, through the door, lying on the kitchen floor.
I'm still stuck at home.

They can say, they can say, it's getting better.
But I say, but I say they've lost their minds.
I don't care, I don't care if you think it's better.
'Til Fauci says, think I'm gonna stay insIIIIDE!

'Cause every night I lie in bed,
The mindless existential dread.
A million memes are keeping me awake.
I think of what the world would be.
If it weren't for COVID-19
A million memes is all it's gonna take.
Oh, I hope the world's still here when I awake.

In my house, on the hill,
I got my first electric bill.
And I don't have money.
The special things I've compiled,
Go on eBay in a while.
So I have some food to eat.

They can say, they can say, ""conserve your money""
They can wait, they can wait, for stim check 3.
I don't care, I don't care, cause I spent my money.
Think it's time for an online shopping spree!

'Cause every night I lie in bed,
With mindless existential dread.
Delivery dates are keepin' me awake.
I think of when I'll get my things,
'Cause I'm too tired of these memes.
A million orders is all it's gonna take.
Oh, a million orders with the cash I didn't make.

However big, however small,
There aren't any gatherings at all.
Grab your PPE.
You're up all night, you sleep all day,
But tell me that you're still okay.
'Cause I miss outside.
But I know that I've made up my mind.
I'm gonna stay inside.

'Cause every night I lie in bed,
With mindless existential dread.
A Zoom meeting is keeping me awake.
I think of how I'll graduate.
When I don't even know my name.
A million dreams is all it's gonna take.
Oh, a million dreams for the world Corona made.
For the world Corona made..",-0.98,Negative,0.05051020408163265,Netural,-0.29288944602012634,Negative

"I close my eyes and I can see
The world that's waiting up for me
That I call my own
Through the dark, through the door
Through where no one's been before
But it feels like home

They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say I've lost my mind
I don't care, I don't care, so call me crazy
We can live in a world that we design

'Cause every night I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make

There's a house we can build
Every room inside is filled
With things from far away
The special things I compile
Each one there to make you smile
On a rainy day

They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say we've lost our minds
I don't care, I don't care if they call us crazy
Runaway to a world that we design

Every night I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make

However big, however small
Let me be part of it all
Share your dreams with me
You may be right, you may be wrong
But say that you'll bring me along
To the world you see
To the world I close my eyes to see
I close my eyes to see

Every night I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make

For the world we're gonna make",0.9907,Positive,-0.07471861471861473,Negative,0.4922201633453369,Positive
