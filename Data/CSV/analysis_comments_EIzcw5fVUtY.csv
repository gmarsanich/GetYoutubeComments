Randy should start looking forward on becoming the next champ taking the title from Roman he is an icon and dangerous  he has a better history and can beat Roman   Randy should become the first one to win the title 20 time before he retires.    Congratulations randy I hope you become a Legend killer again and take what belongs to you.  The titles,0.8481,Positive,0.2333333333333333,Positive,-0.3402341604232788,Negative
"all the stuff Ezekiel or Elias and the usos(even though they're heels) makes me sad of how Randy Orton is getting old and just how long he's been wrestling for😪I'm only 15 but been watching wrestling since I was born and remember bald '09 randy and rivalries he has in the late 2000's I remember legacy too. I remember him saying and just watching back how he was just a new kid in wwe 24 years old and how supposedly he had to prove he was worthy of being in wwe and that he was going to be in the main event and win world titles and carry on his fathers legacy, now he's an experienced veteran surrounded by all these young guys as the last of his Era, even though it feels like his Era was just starting yesterday, with him and the ovw 2002 class all starting out. Randy has always and will always be my favorite wrestler. his dedication and loyalty and hustle and just his consistency AND his willingness to put over others not always be in the main event has made him my favorite of all time for sure",0.9843,Positive,0.1596681096681096,Positive,0.5638378858566284,Positive
