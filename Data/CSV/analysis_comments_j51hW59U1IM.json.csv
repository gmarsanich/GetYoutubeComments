Dumb comment to post on this video but like Honesty I haven‚Äôt had a favorite ‚ÄúCOMFORT‚Äù YouTuber in a while and recently I‚Äôve had a hard week for me in school and out but me being the extrovert I am I get most of my serotonin and energy from talking or hanging out with people and over my 4 day week it was hard from just a lot of things in my life and watching your videos made it better I was in the middle of having to listen to another argument that my dad started with my mom and I turned on the tartar sauce popsicle video and I forgot all about my worries. The other day i had a horrible day at school and I just needed to be cheered up so I turned on the cards against humanity videos and i felt way better. Just too simplify what I mean is that I really okay I don‚Äôt know how to word this but like sorta idolize you. You manage to put a smile on my face with HOURS of ugly crying but I really love your videos and I hope you see this and just know I would literally give my whole family and my left kidney to meet you ‚òπÔ∏è‚úã,0.9758,Positive,0.01074561403508772,Netural,-0.30106261372566223,Negative
