Just goes to show how powerful Michael's message still is even to this day.. through music. Sadly the World as we know it (2022 and beyond) may never recover. As MJ sung 'Where did we go wrong?' 🎶 I feel in this moment in time (like others) helpless to try and help reverse all the damage that has already been done. Also my thoughts and prayers go out to the Ukraine. 🇺🇦

"Night Count #82/#365: ☔
[11 LONELY WEEKS HAS PAST] and aiming to be 2 years clean of self-harm of cutting my wrists by December.

The 82nd. day after I lose my will and trust with humans with as my Soul-Crushing Soul listens to MJ Earth daily for another month. 🌎

I also refuse to reply any comments as I have generalized anxiety, ptsd, trust issues, and autism to communicate with people so I apologize for that. 

Hope you have a nice warm night! 🌙

- Love, Skully 💀

*PS:* This is NOT a prank as I really almost had the urge to cut my wrists last evening and feeling I can't ever form friendships as everyone blocks me and not having any friends whatsoever. 

*PSS:* I'M 16 MONTHS CLEAN and still struggling to do my best to be after all the loneliness and being bullied for my autism. I also have witnessed a strange Mexican Man tonight that was doing a Catholic Pose I think near by a street and felt weirded out and asked if he was okay as he seemed to be on drugs.

After reading the comments, I see hope for future as the younger generations from all over the world shares the same ideas and beliefs for peace and love in the world.

The internet and social media are shrinking the world where everyone is aware of what is happening in other counties which, is why some countries blocks it.  However, they cannot block it forever!

So, in the next decade, the majority of the Boomers will be gone, and it is in my prayers that your generation will hand over the next generation a peaceful world!

"Earth Song
Song by Michael Jackson

What about sunrise?
What about rain?
What about all the things
That you said we were to gain?
What about killing fields?
Is there a time?
What about all the things
That you said was yours and mine?
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores?
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
What have we done to the world?
Look what we've done
What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son?
What about flowering fields?
Is there a time?
What about all the dreams
That you said was yours and mine?
Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores?
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know we've drifted far
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Hey, what about yesterday?
(What about us?)
What about the seas?
(What about us?)
The heavens are falling down
(What about us?)
I can't even breathe
(What about us?)
What about apathy?
(What about us?)
I need you
(What about us?)
What about nature's worth?
(Ooh)
It's our planet's womb
(What about us?)
What about animals?
(What about it?)
We've turned kingdoms to dust
(What about us?)
What about elephants?
(What about us?)
Have we lost their trust
(What about us?)
What about crying whales?
(What about us?)
We're ravaging the seas
(What about us?)
What about forest trails?
(Ooh)
Burnt despite our pleas
(What about us?)
What about the holy land?
(What about it?)
Torn apart by creed
(What about us?)
What about the common man?
(What about us?)
Can't we set him free
(What about us?)
What about children dying?
(What about us?)
Can't you hear them cry?
(What about us?)
Where did we go wrong?
(Ooh)
Someone tell me why
(What about us?)
What about baby boy?
(What about it?)
What about the days?
(What about us?)
What about all their joy?
(What about us?)
What about the man?
(What about us?)
What about the crying man?
(What about us?)
What about Abraham?
(What about us?)
What about death again?
(Ooh)
Do we give a damn?
