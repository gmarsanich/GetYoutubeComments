"Lyrics
I stay out too late, got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, that's what people say
I go on too many dates, but I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, that's what people say
But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music in my mind
Saying it's gonna be alright
I never miss a beat, I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, that's what they don't see
Players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break
Fakers gonna fake
I'm just gonna shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

seeing Taylor grow over the past 10 years has been so inspiring. She showed the world that anything is possible. My dream is to be a musician. My music is blowing up right now, speaking it into existence 🗣

This video made me fall in love with her. She's acting like she went into this music video blind and just went with it which I love. It's shows like a real side to her. I have became such a fan, if I have a daughter, her name is gonna be Taylor.

Taylor swift will always have a place in my heart. She was my favorite singer when I was younger. Whenever I listen to her songs It brings back such nostalgia of a time I wish I could go back to

She actually wrote this song about people who would say she's a bad dancer. She decided to awkwardly dance throughout the whole video just like the haters would all point out.

ADirector who worked with Marilyn Monroe was very annoyed whenever she forgot a line between takes she would do the same thing with her hands that Taylor does in this video for some reason whenever I see this video I imagine how nice it would’ve been if someone had put together a song and a musical number like this for Marilyn Monroe with many of the stars of her generationI I imagine Jackie Gleason and Art Carney dancing in the background just Being associated with the creation of something so lighthearted would have lifted some of the weight of negative thoughts and emotions and she carried around with her during the last year‘s of her life,0.5752,Positive,0.0399999999999999,Neutral,-0.3571780323982239,Negative

"I stay out too late, got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, that's what people say
I go on too many dates, but I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, that's what people say
But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music in my mind
Saying it's gonna be alright
I never miss a beat, I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, that's what they don't see
Players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break
Fakers gonna fake
I'm just gonna shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I, shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I, shake it off, I shake it off
