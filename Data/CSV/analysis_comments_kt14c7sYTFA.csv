"My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why, I got out of bed at all

The morning rain cloud up my window
And I can't see at all

And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Damn I really cried. Imaging it all in my head. I never liked Eminem but I can’t lie this is really good. It’s a whole story a movie almost and you can feel it. Like you’re there. It’s sad because many people do this in real without hope idolize celebrities and when they are ignored not even intentionally sometimes or arrested for their behavior they harm others or themselves sometimes even their idol. Never getting help. Never idolize people. You can look up to someone but don’t be a stan. This song is a 10/10 for me.

"I rewrote this gorgeousness and made it a version about ""The Office."" 
*My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all.
The morning rain clouds up my window.
And I can't see at all.
And even if I could it would all be gray.
But your picture on my wall,
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
It's not so bad.

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all.
The morning rain clouds up my window.
And I can't see at all.
And even if I could it would all be gray.
But your picture on my wall,
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
It's not so bad..


Dear Michael, I wrote you but still aren't calling
 I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom.
 I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not have got them.
 There probably was a problem at the post office or something.
 I saw that girl you were hanging out with, I forgot her name, I think it's Holly.
 But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, Mike? How's the office?
 My work load is huge and didn't Meredith crack her pelvis?
 I feel like I agree with you and we need some time apart.
 I'm glad you are checking up on me, but your letter hurt my heart. 
I heard about your old boss too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill herself over some bitch who didn't want her.
 I know you probably hear this from me everyday, but I really want you back.
 I even got your work done for you, and I left it in a neat stack.
 I got a better room for you, and a full sized bed. 
I like the shit you did with the website, now you can work ahead.
 Anyways, I hope you get this Michael,
 hit me back, Just to chat, truly yours, 
your biggest fan, This is Jan.

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all.
The morning rain clouds up my window.
And I can't see at all.
And even if I could it would all be gray.
But your picture on my wall,
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
It's not so bad..

Dear Michael, you still haven't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance.
 I'm not mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer me.
 If you didn't wanna talk to me outside the office,
 You didn't have to, but you could have sent me a message.
 The internet connection is perfect, Michael, so don't make that excuse.
 I waited in the blistering cold for you. For four hours and you just said, ""No.""
 That's pretty shitty Michael, and you ignored my Email. 
You said you would call me, and now I know that isn't true.
 I’m not that mad though, I just don't like being lied to. 
Remember when we met at Chili's, you said if I'd call you you would call back.
 See I'm just like you in a way, I get nervous when under pressure too.
 I barely get any work done in a day.
 I have a collection of candles at my house downstairs,
 So when I'm under stress, I go down there and take a day. 
'Cause I don't really got anything else
 so that shit helps when I'm depressed
 I even got a surgery for my chest because beauty comes in pairs.
 Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds.
 It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me.
 See everything you say is real, and I miss you 24/7
 But, A lot of times I get jealous when you talk to other women
 But they don't know you like I know you Michael, no one does.
 They don't know what it was like for me growing up, you gotta call me, dear. 
If you don't respond, my sanity will soon disappear.
 Sincerely yours, Jan.
 P.S. we should get back together too.

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all.
The morning rain clouds up my window.
And I can't see at all.
And even if I could it would all be gray.
But your picture on my wall,
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
It's not so bad..

Dear Mister ""I'm Too Good To Call Or Write To Jan!""
 This will be the last package I ever send your ass!
 It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it!
 I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on them perfect!
 So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it!
 I'm in the car right now, I'm going away, but I don't know where.
 Hey Mike, I drank a fifth of vodka.
 You dare me to drive?
 You know the time I promised I wouldn't let go of you?
 Yeah, I lied, we're done,
 but that's fine!
 I swear if you come crawling back, I won't care!
 I'm taking all my crap with me, which includes your new watch, too!
 Now it's too late, I'm a thousand miles away now.
 And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call!
 I hope you know I ripped all of your awards off the wall!
 I love you Michael! we could have been together, think about it!
 You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it!
 And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it!
 I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me!
 See Michael- shut up bitch! I'm trying to talk!
 Hey Mike, that's Dwight screaming in the back seat!
 But I didn't tell him what it's about, I just tied him up, see I'm not like you!
 'Cause if he puts together the pieces, he'll tell everyone I'm insane.
 He keeps insisting that he understands my pain, but no-
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out!?!?

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all.
The morning rain clouds up my window.
And I can't see at all.
And even if I could it would all be gray.
But your picture on my wall,
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
It's not so bad..


Dear Jan, I meant to write you sooner but I've just been busy.
 You said you have stress problems too?
 Look, I'm really flattered that you care so much.
 And my workload is swamped, so I can't leave the office early.
 I'm sorry I didn't see you outside, I must have missed you.
 Don't think I did that intentionally just to diss you.
 But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists?
 Please Don't hurt yourself, you will regret it soon.
 You have some issues Jan,
 I think you need some counseling
 To help you from bouncing off the walls when you get down some.
 And what's this about us meant get back together?
 That type of thing will make me not want us to meet each other.
 I really think you need to calm down and invest in your interest further. 
Or maybe you just need to talk to your boss later.
 I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time Before you hurt yourself,
 I think that you'll be doing just fine.
 If you relax a little, I'm glad I can help you, but Jan 
Why are you so mad?
 Try to understand that I do want you as a friend.
 I just don't want you to do some crazy shit.
 I saw this one thing on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick.
 Some girl was drunk and drove her car in a lake.
 And had her ex's coworker in the back, but they lived.
 And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to.
 Come to think about it, her name was- it was you.

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For four hours and you just said, ""No.""
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back
See I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. we should be together too
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Mister ""I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans""
This will be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka
You dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim, shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was, it was you

"My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again
And even if I'm there, they'll all imply
That I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad
It's not so bad
And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life
Oh, just to be with you
Is having the best day of my life
Push the door, I'm home at last
And I'm soaking through and through
And then you handed me a towel
And all I see is you
And even if my house falls down now
I wouldn't have a clue
Because you're near me
And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life
Oh, just to be with you
Is having the best day of my life
And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life
Oh, just to be with you
Is having the best day of my life",0.9967,Positive,0.1219135802469136,Neutral,0.2535534501075744,Neutral
