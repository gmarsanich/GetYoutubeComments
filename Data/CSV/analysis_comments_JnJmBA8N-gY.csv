"Cuatro abrazos y un café
Apenas me desperté
Y al mirarte recordé
Que ya todo lo encontré
Tu mano en mi mano
De todo escapamos
Juntos, ver el sol caer
(Let them enjoy the Paradise)

Vamos pa' la playa, pa’ curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe, viendo tu cintura
Tú le coqueteas, tú eres buscabulla y me gusta

Lento y contento
cara al viento
Lento y contento
Cara al viento

(Farru)
Y aprovecha que el sol 'tá caliente
Y vamo' a disfrutar el ambiente
Vámono’ a meternos pa'l agua
Pa' que veas que rico se siente

Y vámono' en tropical
Por to'a la costa a chinchorrear
De chinchorro a chinchorro
Paramo' a darno' una Medalla
Bien fría pa' bajar la sequía
Un poco de Bob Marley
Y unos tragos ’e sangría

Pa’ que te sueltes
Poco a poquito
Porque pa' vacilar
No hay que salir de Puerto Rico

Y dale lento
Date un shot de Coquito
Y como dice Fonsi
Vamo’ a darle despacito

Pa’ que te sueltes
Poco a poquito
Porque pa' vacilar
No hay que salir de Puerto Rico

Vamos pa' la playa, pa’ curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe, viendo tu cintura
Tú le coqueteas, tú eres buscabulla

Vamos pa' la playa, pa’ curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe, viendo tu cintura
Tú le coqueteas, baby, tú estás dura y me gusta

Lento y contento
Cara al viento
Lento y contento
Cara al viento

Y darle lento, meterle violento
Te puse reggaetón pa' que me apague' ese cuerpo
Métele hasta abajo, está duro ese movimiento
El único testigo que tenemos aquí e' el viento

Y dale, métele cintura
Mátame con tu hermosura
Mira cómo me frontea
Porque sabe que está dura

Calma, mi vida, con calma
Que nada hace falta
Si estamos juntitos andando

Calma, mi vida, con calma
Que nada hace falta
Si estamos juntitos bailando

Vamos pa' la playa, pa’ curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe, viendo tu cintura
Tú le coqueteas, tú eres buscabulla

Vamos pa' la playa, pa’ curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar Caribe, viendo tu cintura
Tú le coqueteas, baby, tú estás dura y me gusta

"CÓMO SE ADMINISTRA LA VIDA DE LAS PERSONAS


1ª opción: vida cómoda (contactos humanos, diversión, relaciones, trabajo fácil)

2ª elección: remediar la que hace la primera elección (todo lo contrario de la vida de la primera) 

3ª elección, etc.: sin personalidad adecuada para sobrevivir, vida probable como vagabundo (en medio de la calle), absolutamente ningún contacto humano, diversión, futuro, cosas preciosas, relaciones. Con la personalidad que te dan para hacer todas estas cosas será demasiado complicado. Probables actos de violencia o discriminación, sin trabajo o si hay muy duro. Alta probabilidad de suicidio. 

Procedimiento: llega un momento en que de repente Cristo y Satanás aparecen frente al espejo y por la fuerza del engaño para elegir uno de los dos. Al elegir la primera, suceden las siguientes cosas: Cristo, la Virgen María y en caso de que a algunos santos aaparecen y en caso de que estés jugando o divirtiéndote de alguna manera te obligan a trabajar y trabajar ayudando a alguien siempre con su voz y sus palabras dentro de tu cabeza. Su procedimiento consiste en esto: evitar que te diviertas, bebas, masturbes, etc. y te hagas trineo como una mula.     
Siendo como dicen segunda opción, solo debes trabajar de la mañana a la noche y nada más. Cualquier otra cosa no es buena para ellos. Al principio Cristo finge ser Dios y te muestra cómo pretende darte regalos poniendo por un momento una especie de resplandor blanco a la altura del ombligo y diciéndote que dan un ""regalo"" a todos y no más de uno pero en realidad, todas son mentiras que a medida que avanzas , salen por su cuenta. Tratan de enmarcarte con vagas promesas, recompensas y varias escoria una vez en lo que llaman ""paraíso"", pero una vez que verifican que el elemento en cuestión no toma el anzuelo (¡porque no es un imbécil!) comienzan a revelar sus infames procedimientos que han implementado para tratar de arruinar su vida.  
Como segunda opción se te da una personalidad muy antisocial, extrema y extraviada para que no puedas tener ningún tipo de contacto con otras personas (amistades, relaciones) porque ves a todos los demás como si vinieran de otro planeta y no hay ningún tipo de compatibilidad. Además de esto tu físico se daña con las siguientes cosas y por las siguientes razones: primero tendrás pocos o ningún músculo en absoluto ya que habiendo sido dañado al nacer estarás enfermo y tendrás la disposición de hacer venganza y guerra contra todos; por segundo tendrás algunos problemas de rodilla que te impedirán practicar cualquier tipo de deporte de forma seria y en tercer lugar tendrás algún tipo de defecto o imperfección en partes íntimas como varias manchas, en, formas extrañas, etc. para evitar que tengas algún tipo de relación.     
La segunda opción debe de acuerdo con su infame sistema tratar de remediar las cosas equivocadas que alguien que murió hace 40 años o más ha combinado. 
En el paraíso se crea una especie de ""círculo"" personal donde están los espíritus de todas las personas que han tenido algún tipo de importancia en tu vida: familiares, ídolos deportivos, músicos, actores o personajes compatibles con tu personalidad o con la vida que tienes que hacer. Todos estos personajes están obligados a aparecer y decir ciertas frases con el propósito de engañar y hacer cosas que la persona en cuestión no haría en sí misma. También aprovechan la relación de admiración que tenías por ellos cuando estaban vivos para conseguir que tengas una conversación, pero todo es mentira, el verdadero propósito es analizar tu forma de pensar y actuar y tu personalidad para ver si puedes superar ciertos obstáculos, trampas y mentiras que intentarán ponerte en el camino.    
De todos los personajes que ves la Virgen María es la más molesta de todas. Habla todo el tiempo diciendo muchas mentiras para ver si alguien es tan estúpido como para creer en ello (como sus monaguillos) y siempre y constantemente repite las mismas cosas hasta las náuseas (procedimiento). Llora todo el tiempo y dice que es la mujer más bella del mundo.     
Su forma de hablar es repetir en tu cabeza sus frases que te irritan y provocan y molestan hasta el punto de las náuseas ya que cuanto más enojado estás, más saltan tus nervios y más vulnerable eres a ellos porque podrías perder el control de tus acciones y hacer lo que quieran. Nunca creen en las amenazas de hacer que se detengan hasta que se pongan en práctica. 

Al principio del viaje si te rebelas contra su infame sistema, pueden recurrir a hacer aparecer al diablo.
No haberlo elegido parece mucho más pobre de lo que parece a sus seguidores. Puede aparecer en muchas formas diferentes, pero por lo general aparece con los ojos rojos y el palo que utiliza para someter a sus seguidores. Entre las cosas que te hace encontramos: imágenes de arañas bastante creíbles en la cabeza, tentaciones de varios tipos muy traicioneras. Al principio te hace pensar que quiere llevarte a su grupo haciéndote siempre arrastres para tratar de enmarcarte (por ejemplo, mujeres que puedas tener, cosas que te pueden pasar, etc.) y luego trata de molestarte por la noche mostrándote sus ojos rojos, patas de cabra, caras extrañas y diciéndote que vengas a su grupo. Para intentar someterse utilizamos una especie de sensación de gran calor a la altura del ombligo que se transmite por todo el cuerpo y que casi da la sensación de desmayo. Se supera estando siempre en compañía de alguien, ya que debe ser sigiloso y no puede dejar huellas. Durante los intentos de sumisión, cada pensamiento, todo lo leído y visto, y cada memoria será utilizada como un arma contra ti.       
En algunas ocasiones puede llegar a decirte que le des tu alma, es decir, que realices el siguiente ritual: escribir explícitamente tu intención en una hoja de papel, sacar sangre de tu cuerpo y firmar con ella. Como acto final quemar la sábana (que es absolutamente para evitar ya que entonces no volver atrás).     
Sus seguidores para conseguir cualquier tipo de papel en el infierno deben sacrificar todo lo que tienen en la vida y matar a alguien, mejor si alguien que les importa o algún completo desconocido y como gesto final ellos mismos. 
Los demonios no pueden sacar nada y debe ser el adepto quien realiza ciertos rituales para aprender cosas nuevas y mejorar el nivel, pero en cada uno de estos actos sus vidas se arruinan cada vez más.
El infierno consta de 9 niveles. 
Las almas de las personas que se suicidan son golpeadas por los ojos poco a poco hasta que se les arrancan los ojos, un proceso que dura años y tienen que dar 15 vueltas antes de poder salvarse.",-0.9978,Negative,0.0900519675519675,Positive,-0.4286070168018341,Negative

"This song is near and dear to the hearts of the fans of the Washington Nationals baseball team. During 2019, on their way to winning the World Series, one of the players named Brian Dozier spent hours learning all the words to the song from his Hispanic teammates during the long trips they took to play other teams. As they started winning playoff series the players would hold wild celebrations in their locker room, pouring beer and champagne, and Dozier started stripping off his shirt as he swigged beer and sang along with the entire song as it played in the background. Even during the triumphant parade through Washington DC to congratulate the team and thank the fans this song was played, and Dozier stripped off his shirt and sang along to it with the rest of his teammates who knew the words. It was magic. 

Brian is retired now, but this season after every game one can hear the song being played on the public address system as we leave the stadium. Many fans have no idea what the words mean, but they love that song because it reminds them of a beautiful, improbable, and ultimately successful march to the World Championship.",0.9897,Positive,0.1801470588235294,Positive,0.6136422753334045,Positive

we run away from everything

so that we could watch the sunset together

 

Let's go to the beach

to heal your soul

turn off your phone

and have a beer

whole Carribean sea

is looking at your hips

you're flirting with them

you are troublemaker

and I like it

 

Slowly and happy, facing the wind

Slowly and happy, facing the wind

 

To feel the sand underneath my feet

to get a suntan

to play like children, giving each other affection

just like the first time I saw you

I knew I'll be near your feet

from the first time they touched each other

 

Your hand in my hand

we run away from everything

so that we could watch the sunset together

 

Let's go to the beach

to heal your soul

turn off your phone

and have a beer

whole Carribean sea

is looking at your hips

you're flirting with them

you are troublemaker

 

Let's go to the beach

Slowly and happy, facing the wind

 

Calmness, my life, calmly

because we have everything if we're walking together

Calmness, my life, calmly

because we have everything if we're dancing together

Calmness, my life, calmly

because we have everything if we're walking together

Calmness, my life, calmly

Cuatro abrazos y un café

Pa' que el sol nos pinte la piel

"Si está estresado con frecuencia, a menudo cansado, encuentra la paz mental o tal vez simplemente busca un mayor significado y propósito en la vida, entonces probablemente esté listo para la meditación Raja Yoga.

La meditación Raja Yoga es una técnica con los ojos abiertos que puede ser utilizada por cualquier persona, en cualquier lugar. Ya sea que desee aprender a relajarse, necesite ser más concentrado y creativo o esté buscando la iluminación personal, la meditación Raja Yoga puede satisfacer cada una de esas necesidades.

Los Brahma Kumaris enseñan Raja Yoga, una práctica de meditación combinada con el autoconocimiento espiritual. El curso de meditación no se basa en un régimen de posturas físicas, sino más bien en una comprensión del funcionamiento de la mente, el intelecto y el subconsciente y la capacidad de aplicar este conocimiento en situaciones cotidianas.

Title: Calm Down
Lyrics: 
Four hugs 💖 and a coffee ☕
I barley wake up...
And when I looked at you 🥺👀 I remembered, that I already found everything...
Your hand in my hand 🤝🏻🥰
From everything we escape...
Together watch the sun go down 🌅👫🏽
Let's go to the beach ⛱😎
To heal ✨ your soul...
Close the screen...
Open the medal...
All the Caribbean Sea 😁
Watching 👀 your waist...
You flirt~
You are a bully 😤🥺
And I like 😏
Slow and happy, facing the wind...💨
(2x).............
To feel the sand on your feet...
So that the sun can paint 🎨 our skin...
To play like children, give us love 💘
Like the first time I looked at you 😌
I knew I would be at your feet 🥺🥺
Since they had touched...
Your hand and my hand 🙏🏻
And we escape from everything...
Together ❤🤲🏻 watch the sun go down...
Let's go to the beach ⛱
To heal your soul...
Close the screen...
Open the medal...
All the Caribbean Sea...
Watching your waist...
You flirt 😋😉
You are a bully 😤💓
Let's go to the beach ⛱😎
To heal ✨ your soul...
Close the screen...
Open the medal...
All the Caribbean Sea...
Watching 👀 your waist...
You flirt 🤭
You are a bully 😤💓
And I like 😏🥺💖
Slow and happy, facing the wind...💨
(2x).............
Easy, my life, easy...
That nothing is needed if we are together ❤😌✨ dancing 🕺+💃
Easy, my life, easy...
