"I somehow only found this song a couple of years ago after 2020 lockdown . I was listening to afterglow when it was new and then heard this and realised how similar I though they sounded, so I listened to photograph again. And again. And again. Until I had memorised every single note and none could go unnoticed in my head. Then, in 2021, we went into lockdown in New Zealand for 2 terms and so I taught myself how to play it. The I taught my brother. Now I must know how to play at least 50 or so of his songs - that I can remember. I am so shocked that I had no idea who he was in 2020, disappointed in myself for not knowing that all the songs I loved were by him. He literally saved my life in lockdown twice.

"Lyrics : 

Loving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Times forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer
'Til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know (know)
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
Times forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer
'Til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone

And if you hurt me
That's OK, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat
Where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well, that's OK, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away
I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost
Back on 6th street
Hearing you whisper through the phone

"Uma vez eu conheci alguém, e eu amei de uma forma que nunca fora testada anteriormente. Cometi erros, mas me esforçava para que tudo fosse o que imaginei que o amor seria. E foi! Houveram belos dias, em que a satisfação e pertencimento ao momento geraram sensações inenarráveis. Era tomado por uma felicidade tão grande e constante que, por vezes, causava dependência. E no momento mais bonito, tudo acabou. Não por culpa de um ou d'outro, mas por circunstâncias maiores que amor. O destino, enquanto brinca ao ensinar, nos faz provar o mais doce e também experimentar o mais amargo. Me apeguei a essa música, dolorosamente. Passaram-se dias, semanas, meses e completaram-se anos. E tudo o que eu pensava era: será que um dia, ouvirei sem sentir dor? Nunca houve absoluta certeza, pois o simples acaso de me deparar com a melodia, gerava um sentimento superior a maturidade ou controle emocional. E por vezes e vezes eu chorei, com essa mesma versão. O tempo não ajudou, muito embora sempre me questionasse sobre ""quando""? Até que um dia, o amor me curou. E esse sentimento foi advento de algo que, embora transcendesse meu ser, se conflitava com uma barreira de proteção. Não por medo, tampouco falta de esperança, mas voltado única e exclusivamente a minha pessoa. O amor, de fato, é a cura. E o amor próprio foi a resposta. Sim, foi tão possível me sentir machucado quanto curado por esse sentimento. Quando ama-se a si, o amor pode curar. É capaz de reparar todos os danos e dar tanto aos dias, músicas e sentimento a capacidade de ressignificação. O amor permanece por aí, e está aqui. E será sempre surpreendentemente belo, apesar de quando e como o encontramos ou desencontramos. E também viverá no que permanece. Portanto, sempre será uma honra viver para amar.",0.9986,Positive,0.3221533516988062,Positive,0.7303440570831299,Positive

"Bu şarkıya bayılıyorum bana kedimi cesurumu hatırlatıyor. bu şarkıyı çok severdi çok dinleyemedi ama en sevdiği şarkıydı, o yüzden bu şarkıyı ne zaman duysam aklıma o geliyor hanı içimizde mutlulu olur ama bi yandanda onu özlersiniz ya ağlamak istersiniz hatta ağlarsınız ama yinede mutlusunuzdur. her gece onu dusunuyorum. Ne zaman biri bana şiddet uygulasa o kişiyi ısırıyor, bana herkesten fazla sevgi gösterdi, hiç arkadaşım yoktu tek arkadaşım oydu, beni okula kadar götürür cikarkende okulun kapısında beklerdi, agladigim zamanlar beni güldürmek için komik komik şakalar yapardı, beraber gezerdik benim çocukluğum onun sayesinde güzel geçti. daha cok bir suru güzel animiz vardı. Bunu Insanlara anlatıyorum ""ne abarttin alt tarafı bi kedi"" diyorlar. Bu yüzden bunu nu şarkıya yazmak istedim bu şarkıyla hep anılarımız aklıma geliyor... keşke gitmeseydin keske seni uzaklara koymasalardi umarim simdi iyisindir ve mutlusundur ve ozur dilerim o gun seni birakip kuzenimde kalmaya gittigim icin. 4 yildir seni ozluyorum umarım bir yerde bir şekilde tekrar karşılaşırız... 🌞🐈💛",0.9959,Positive,0.3817361111111111,Positive,0.4259074330329895,Positive

"Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
Hmm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die

Hmm, we keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone

And if you hurt me
That's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
""Wait for me to come home""

"Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
Hmm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
Hmm, we keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone

I had something like this yesterday. I had a dream about my dog that died 2 years ago, but I didn't remember it clearly. The next day I started listening to this song and suddenly I started remembering the dream. I had a dream where I hugged my dog and relived the moment I felt it. even feeling him in my dream after 2 years made me cry. This song will remind me of the moment I hugged my lost dog.

"Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
Hmm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
Hmm, we keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

"Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
Hmm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die

Hmm, we keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone

And if you hurt me
That's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
