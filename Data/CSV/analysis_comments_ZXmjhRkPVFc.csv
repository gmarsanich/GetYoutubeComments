First time I realized he wasn't singing.  Which is staggering considering what Nuclear explosion this five minutes performance was. Before this day he was just a guy who went solo from the Jackson 5. The day after this he became the most famous person since Jesus Christ. And that is not an exaggeration. Think of the most famous person today or the last 20 years.

I remember sitting with my family watching this at the age of 4.  I knew I was watching a genius at work. In my mind I just thought I would never ever witness a moment like this ever again. I was in complete awe of him and I still am to this day. However I have come to the realisation that this performance touched millions of people around the world to be inspired. Just to add nobody really talks about 3:34 -3:39 which is the dance routine just before the moonwalk. That segment of dance is just brilliant because it makes the moonwalk look so effortless.,0.8591,Positive,0.4000000000000001,Positive,0.5791592597961426,Positive

From a movie scene
I said, ¬´¬†Don‚Äôt mind, but what do you mean
I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?¬†¬ª
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me, ¬´¬†Be careful of what you do.
And don‚Äôt go around breaking young girls‚Äô hearts.¬†¬ª
And mother always told me, ¬´¬†A-be careful of who you love,
And be careful of what you do
‚ÄòCause the lie becomes the truth.¬†¬ª
Billie Jean is not my lover
She‚Äôs just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
For forty days and for forty nights
Law was on her side
But who can stand
When she‚Äôs in demand
Her schemes and plans
‚ÄòCause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice.)
She told, ¬´¬†My baby, we‚Äôd danced ‚Äôtil three.¬†¬ª
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cry
His eyes looked like mine, oh, no
Do a dance on the floor in the round, baby
A-people always told me, ¬´¬†Be careful of what you do
And don‚Äôt go around breaking young girls‚Äô hearts.¬†¬ª
(Don‚Äôt break no heart.)
A-but she came and stood right by me
And just the smell of sweet perfume
And this happened much too soon
And she called me to her room
Billie Jean is not my lover
She‚Äôs just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She‚Äôs just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No, no, no
Billie Jean is not my lover
She‚Äôs just a girl who claims that I am the one
(No, there‚Äôs not me, baby.)
But the kid is not my son
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no.)
She says I am the one (No, babe.)
But the kid is not my son, no, no, no
She says I am the one
You know what you did
She says he is my son
Breaking my heart, babe
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
She is the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
She is the one
Don‚Äôt call me Billie Jean
Billie Jean is not my lover
She is the one
She stumbled onto the scene
Billie Jean is not my lover
