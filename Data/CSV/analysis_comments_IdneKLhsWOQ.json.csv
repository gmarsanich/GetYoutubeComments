Taylor doesn’t need lipstick to be stunning…Case in point the “Safe and Sound” video is the prettiest I’ve ever seen her look! Although this video is stunning and draws you into the story that they are acting out. And the song it’s self is my second favorite! Taylor you’re a peach!

"She walks in beauty
like the night

 Of cloudless climes and starry skies
 And all that’s best of dark and bright Meet in her aspect and her eyes; Thus mellowed to that tender light Which heaven to gaudy day denies. One shade the more
one ray the less 
Had half impaired the nameless grace 
Which waves in every raven tress 
Or softly lightens o’er her face;

 Where thoughts serenely sweet express
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place. And on that cheek, and o’er that brow, So soft, so calm, yet eloquent, The smiles that win, the tints that glow

But tell of days in goodness spent, A mind at peace with all below, A heart whose love is innocent",0.9908,Positive,0.24894179894179894,Netural,0.6417129635810852,Positive

"Ele disse: Vamos sair desta cidade
Dirigir até saírmos dela
Para longe das multidões
Pensei: Nem os céus podem me ajudar agora
Nada dura para sempre
Mas isso vai acabar comigo

Ele é tão alto e bonito pra cacete
Ele é tão mau, mas ele faz tão bem
Já posso ver o fim quando tudo começa
Minha única condição é

Diga que você se lembrará de mim
Usando um belo vestido
Olhando para o pôr do Sol, querido
Lábios vermelhos e bochechas rosadas
Diga que você me verá de novo
Mesmo que seja apenas em seus
Sonhos mais selvagens, ah, ah, aah
Sonhos mais selvagens, ah, ah, aah

Eu disse: Ninguém precisa saber o que fazemos
As mãos dele estão no meu cabelo
As roupas dele estão no quarto
E sua voz é um som familiar
Nada dura para sempre
Mas isso está ficando bom agora

Ele é tão alto e bonito pra cacete
Ele é tão mau, mas ele faz tão bem
E quando nós demos nosso último beijo
Meu último pedido, é esse

Diga que você se lembrará de mim
Usando um belo vestido
Olhando para o pôr do Sol, querido
Lábios vermelhos e bochechas rosadas
Diga que você me verá de novo
Mesmo que seja apenas em seus
Sonhos mais selvagens, ah, ah, aah (aah)
Sonhos mais selvagens, ah, ah, aah

Você me verá em retrospectiva
Enroscada com você a noite toda
Ardendo em chamas
Um dia, quando você me deixar
Aposto que essas memórias
Seguirão você em toda parte

Você me verá em retrospectiva
Enroscada com você a noite toda
Ardendo em chamas (chamas)
Um dia quando você me deixar
Aposto que essas memórias
Seguirão você em toda parte (seguirão você em toda parte)

Diga que você se lembrará de mim
Usando um belo vestido
Olhando para o pôr do Sol, querido
Lábios vermelhos e bochechas rosadas
Diga que você me verá de novo
Mesmo que você esteja apenas fingindo

Diga que você se lembrará de mim
Usando em um belo vestido
Olhando para o pôr do Sol, querido
Lábios vermelhos e bochechas rosadas
Diga que você me verá de novo
Mesmo que seja apenas em seus (apenas fingindo, apenas fingindo)
Sonhos mais selvagens, ah, ah, aah (aah)
