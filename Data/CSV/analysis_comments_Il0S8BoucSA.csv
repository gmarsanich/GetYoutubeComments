"I took an arrow to the heart
내 심장에 꽂힌 화살
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
네 입술만큼 맛있는 키스를 해본 적이 없어
Strawberries and somethin' more
딸기맛, 그리고 더 많은 맛을
Ooh yeah, I want it all
다 느껴보고 싶어
Lipstick on my guitar (Ooh)
내 기타에 립스틱이 묻었어
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
엔진을 가득 채우고, 멀리 드라이브를 가자
Go dancin' underneath the stars
별들이 수놓아진 하늘 아래에서 춤추러 가자
Ooh yeah, I want it all
너와는 다 해보고 싶어
Mh, you got me feelin' like
너 때문에 난
I wanna be that guy
네 남자가 되고 싶어
I wanna kiss your eyes
네 눈에 키스하고 싶어
I wanna drink that smile
네 미소를 마시고 싶어
I wanna feel like I'm—
그런 느낌을 받고 싶어
Like my soul's on fire
내 영혼이 불타는 느낌 말이야
I wanna stay up all day and all night
낮이고 밤이고 종일 깨어있고 싶어
Yeah, you got me singin' like
너 때문에 난 이렇게 노래해
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
네가 이럴 때마다 참 사랑스러워
And when you're closer, give me thе shivers
네가 가까이 오면, 마음이 떨려
Oh, baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
햇살이 흩어질 때까지 춤추고 싶니?
And whеn they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
그들의 파티가 끝나면, 우리 둘만의 파티를 시작하는 거야
And we'll say, ooh, I love it when you do it like that
그리고 우린, 네가 이럴 때 참 사랑스러워
And when you're closer, give me the shivers
네가 가까이 오면, 내 마음이 짜릿해져
Oh, baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
햇살이 부서질 때까지 춤추고 싶니?
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
그들의 파티가 끝나면, 우리만의 파티를 시작하는 거야
Into the car, on the back seat in the moonlit dark
차에 올라타, 어두운 달빛이 비추는 뒷좌석으로 가
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
네 두 다리, 두 팔로 날 감싸
Ooh, I can't get enough
난 더 못 참겠어
You know you could tear me apart (Ooh)
날 갈기갈기 찢어놔
Put me back together and take my heart
도로 붙여놓고 내 심장을 가져가
I never thought that I could love this hard
난 내가 이렇게 뜨겁게 사랑할 거라고 생각하지 못했어
Ooh, I can't get enough
난 더 못 참겠어

네가 주는 불꽃같은 사랑에 가슴이 떨려

"I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and then something more
Ooh yeah, I want it all

Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancing underneath the stars
Ooh yeah, I want it all

Mmm, you got me feeling like

I wanna be that guy
I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile
I wanna feel like I
Like my soul's on fire
I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singing like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back

Into the car
On the backseat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh, I can't get enough

You know you could tear me apart
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Ooh, I can't get enough

Mmm, you got me feeling like

I wanna be that guy
I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile
I wanna feel like I
Like my soul's on fire
I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singing like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up

Oh baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up

Oh baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back

Baby, you burn so hot
You make me shiver with the fire you got
This thing we started, I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver-er-er

Baby, you burn so hot
You make me shiver with the fire you got
This thing we started, I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver

"Reviewing the top 10 on the ARIA chart for 20/04/2022. This is number 8. MUSICALLY - Started of interesting then basically evolved into every mediocre Ed Sheeran song. I like Ed Sheeran, the A Team, Castle On The Hill, Crying out Loud and Even Perfect. This has none of that musical interest. I can see where he might want to head but honestly Ed, do what you do best not what everyone else is doing. LYRICALLY No, it is like he had a box full of old lyrics that didn't work for other songs and just threw them together. You have talent to create great music, this isn't it. VIDEO Yeah they are getting more creative I will give it to him but still rather forgettable.

"7533My friend, I wish you serenity and spiritual peace with which you will obtain lasting spiritual happiness
here are some Islamic concepts to eliminate those bad images
 Painted by some deliberately suspected media
 -Islam comes with the ""Quran"", the holy word of Allah.  When you listen to or read it, you will find unprecedented tranquility and spiritual peace
-filling up the spiritual emptiness of the soul by answering all the questions of the soul, including-Why was it created?
 What after death?
  It gives the soul hope and removes anxiety and fear of the future- Islam sets a purpose for
 life It.s a comprehensive lifestyle-
based on justice and  equality-it carries solutions to all life's problems-suitable for every time and place,free of contradictions and myths-it rejects all forms of religious and class distinction
  He holds the scientific lead(the stages of fetal development-the ascent Supports logic and reasoninto space and)He holds the scientific lead(the stages of fetal development-the ascent
Supports logic -
Islam has raised the status of women and established the right for them to live a dignified life -These rights include inheritance rights and property kinship rights, as well as 
the right to work without violating their dignity-Islam prohibits the exploitation of a woman's beauty and youth, and abandons her in old agewhich 
despite deliberate distortions
-is why Western women are more inclined to Islam, because Islam gives them motherhood and psychological stability, especially when they are old, despite deliberate distortions  
The image of Islam to western women - The messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him, is the last messenger of Allah preached by Jesus and Moses, 
may they Thinkers and researchers who study his biography say that he changed the course of history. -Although Islam is deliberately distorted and linked to terrorism from time to time
- despite most Muslims have given up their responsibility to promote Islam, but Islam attracts 2 billion people-Islam ranks first in the world in terms of dissemination-
Islam  It is very popular among 
celebrities the public-through your research On the Internet or on your Muslim community website, you will discover the truth, bring yourself spiritual happiness, 
and make your reality better. -

"r553Islam raised the status of women and addressed her with her humanity and principles, and equalized her with discourse and duties with men- Islam singled out women in the largest wall of the Noble Qur’an, Surat An-Nisa - and the Messenger Muhammad, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, praised all those who honor women - and demanded Hellfire for those who wronged her and cursed- Islam guarantees a woman a decent life throughout her life through inheritance rights and requires spending on her father, husband, and brother - and her right to work that does not jeopardize her dignity- A woman in Islam feels psychological security and stability whenever her body recedes, unlike the woman in the West - at this stage, (mother) Islam is considered the most obligatory respect and appreciation for the mother from all society, especially from children and grandchildren- Gaining the love and approval of the mother represents a path to heaven, and her anger leads to fire in Islam, which is considered the mistress of the family, and everyone loves to win her love - from time to time you find all parties presenting her with gifts- There is nothing in the Muslim family that worries the West about the flight of children from homes - the process of abortion, suicide and the dispersal of the family, which has become a prominent feature in the West in a frightening and increasing manner, and in most countries that claim the freedom of women, especially in girls- The Muslim woman with her veil is the one who owns her freedom, so only the one she loves can see her beauty - unlike the Western woman, she does not have the freedom to control her beauty in front of the owners of sexual frenzy- This is an overview of the Muslim woman.
