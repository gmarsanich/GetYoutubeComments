"I do not know how she is so good. Her videos are also so good and true. She does not hold back. She tells the truth and that is what I love in people. She helps me with all my prop legs when I listen to her lyrics. If you really listen everyone can’t real at to it but a lot of people can. We can’t all have perfect life’s even if we look like we do we don’t. Just because you look happy does not mean you can be sad. I used to act like that but it really helps now that I just don’t hold it in.

"Home alone, tryin' not to eat
Distract myself with pornography
I hate the way she looks at me
I can't stand the dialogue, she would never be
That satisfied, it's a male fantasy
I'm going back to therapy

'Cause I loved you then and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you

I got a call from a girl I used to know
We were inseparable years ago
Thought we'd get along but it wasn't so
And it's all I think about when I'm behind the wheel
I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel
But nothing lasts, I know the deal

But I loved you then and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you

Can't get over you
No matter what I do
I know I should but I could never hate you

"Tw: mentions of suicide, mental abuse


I will never stop believing this song was made for me.

February last year my 6 month relationship with my ex ended due to a huge argument between us which resulted in me breaking up with them in the heat of the moment, the day after obviously regretting it because I was still in love with them, I decided to ask them 2 days after we ended things if we could try again, because I very much wasn’t over them and wasn’t ready for things to be over, turns out they’d already gotten over me and didn’t want a relationship anymore (as in had completely lost feelings for me in 2 days)

After all this happened we decided to stay friends because we had been friends for a few years before we both caught feelings, the entire time I was hoping to be able to make their feelings come back and soon we’d be back together, obviously this wasn’t the case as you can’t force someone to like you and the ways I tried to earn their love back wasn’t very smart, because of this they took advantage of the fact I was still head over heels for them and would mess around with me and flirt with me just to mess with my head, me being way to in love at the time didn’t realise what they were doing and thought they weren’t doing anything wrong.

Fast foward 4 months after we broke up and we are still friends but my feelings for them were still extremely strong and weren’t going anytime soon, so while they gave no care for me in the slightest I was there willing to die for them (I’d given up trying to win them back at this point) It almost felt like it was impossible to get over them, and I remember I genuinely thought I’d never get over them and I’d be stuck in the moment we broke up forever and never get over them, which of course scared the shit out of me. So after months of manipulation, arguments and more but still remaining friends with them on July 26th 2021 I tried to take my own life, I couldn’t bring myself to actually do it as when I was about to one of my family members came into the room, about an hour after this I messaged them telling them what had just happened and asking for me to distance myself from them a bit because I genuinely couldn’t handle feeling like this anymore they didn’t care and preceded to ignore what I said and change the subject.

Fast forward a month later and we are still friends, and on august 16th they told me they had just gotten a girlfriend, and of course because it had been 5 months and I still wasn’t over them I remember crying myself to sleep that night. After this I had to sit there and constantly here them talking about their girlfriend (they knew I wasn’t over them) and I now realise they were very obviously trying to make me jealous, I just wasn’t able to realise it then, which obviously just made my mental state even worse.

October 13th I met someone online who I quickly became friends with as we hit it off and he was the person who finally broke me out of my fucked up mental state and helped me get over my ex as about a month after we started dating, he now helps me try to heal from all that happened last year and is very careful and gentle with me as he knows how much my last relationship damaged me, and I’ve realised I love him 1000 times more than I did my ex even when we were together and I honestly couldn’t be happier.

Although once getting over them I finally realised how shitty they actually treated me, the way they treated me while even when were were dating I later found out is a form of mental abuse, I won’t go into what they did to me as this comment is already way to long and I wouldn’t be able to summerise everything in one paragraph.

I am now no longer friends with them and karma has clearly finally hit them and their now paying the price for how they treated me and are getting made fun of at school and getting treated exactly how they treated me, and no I don’t feel bad, I’m honestly happy about it.

Sorry this comment is so long i honestly didn’t mean for it to me but my point is this song came out a few days after I attempted so whenever I listen to it I constantly feel like it was *made for me*, and every single lyric summerises all the emotions I wasn’t able to put into words 

-Evie <3

"This month get a message from someone male enough whom I can't stand with the statement that I'm no human at all - I see no reason in spending my time over hating. He thinks that I can't love from that. You know I can't stand him and HIS therapist :)  Right now (some three years after I was offered to recollect something from youngsters' monster reactions) I'm listening and watching KoЯn quests in ever evolving hatred worlds - quite verbatim u know ;) I still prefer the one with the advice to beat out some things from ppl's heads. Bits are better :) [I'm really there with the picture of ppl sculls as drums... the girl part was also worth remembering: they were like he beats females in the face, me: i've got no membrane in the center then, take the picture of Firefly spaceship catch device for him to actually fall by Gravity Kills. They've erased two of GK albums from my drive to make me suffer ;]

The thing happens to be Are the love stories tedious and misleading humans or helping to overcome and become eager to live their own lives not alone or with pets. Had a lot of poetical justice fun over ID's Misunderstood. We were too busy in that part of fantasy worlds to think over any therapy at all)) And I persistently choose imaginary IDs (identifications) to make him suffer :] ""I'm here to lead you to the really real world"" ""You'd better be the one who knows how to help ppl with inborn disabilities [like human nature for starters;] to communicate and to not be afraid, not feel outcasted, not to become the asylum for pain spawns by VRs (by VRs themselves) to stay alive.

I'm so sorry that you go through this and if there is anyone else who is going through this right now, you're going to be okay, I promise. It might not seem like it and trust me I know what that feels like but you will be okay soon. Not today, tomorrow, or next week...but soon. It is a very slow process but it will eventually get better. Again I am so sorry that anyone actually has to go through this everyday in their life time.

"Male fantasy 

Home alone, trying not to eat
Distract myself with pornography
I hate the way she looks at me
I can't stand the dialogue, she would never be
That satisfied, it's a male fantasy
I'm going back to therapy

'Cause I loved you then, and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you

I got a call from a girl I used to know
We were inseparable years ago
Thought we'd get along, but it wasn't so
And it's all I think about when I'm behind the wheel
I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel
But nothing lasts, I know the deal

But I loved you then, and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you

Can't get over you
No matter what I do
I know I should, but I could never hate you",0.9147,Positive,-0.0055555555555555,Negative,-0.2965069413185119,Negative

Billie has it, the talent, but simon knew from the start her perception, her point of view, will turn on her someday. I think simon was saying that she have lots more to learn, and her judgement is weak, given that her action in social media, i meant the influence is pure ignorance. She started young, she experienced popularity but took it just like any other teen age girl. just like she said, ""when you let a man have his way, he thinks he owns the world.""",0.7714,Positive,0.1304653679653679,Neutral,-0.4600670039653778,Negative

"Hello🙋‍♂, greetings from Argentina, my name is Gilberto Vargas, 23 years old.
My 😅 English is not very good, but I can learn it through the translator that I write to you, I want to tell you that, of all the musical artists that I have listened to and for me you are the one that stands out. most in my eyes and not because you are a fabulous artist but because of the way you are as a person and beyond what you are now. I don't know if you're going to read this comment :), you must have millions of comments like mine, but hey, I'm glad you read it and the fact that I'm not an artist or famous makes it impossible for me to have your friendship 😥
One day when I'm an artist or famous just like you and when that day comes I'll give you a hug like the one in the movies, but in real life.🤗
