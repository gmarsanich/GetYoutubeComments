"Billie Eilish has a unique style to her music that hasn’t really been done that much with this hard hitting bass 🔊 and smooth drum & trap beats and nice synth and piano 🎹 sounds. She has a very nice soft soothing unique singing voice. She has a great great heart so does her brother. She has two fantastically made albums: ‘When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?’ & ‘Happier Than Ever.’ That’s why people like her.",0.9664,Positive,0.3490277777777777,Positive,0.6349117755889893,Positive

"Quando estou longe de você 
Fico mais feliz do que nunca
Gostaria de poder explicar melhor
Queria que não fosse verdade

Me dê um ou dois dias
Pra pensar em algo inteligente
Pra escrever uma carta para mim mesma
Pra me dizer o que fazer

Você lê minhas entrevistas?
Ou você desvia da minha rua?
Quando você disse que estava de passagem
Eu estava sequer no seu caminho?

Eu sabia que quando eu te pedia para
Ficar de boa com o que eu te contava
Você faria o oposto do que disse que faria
E eu acabaria com mais medo

Não diga que não é justo
Você claramente não estava ciente de que
Me deixou miserável
Então, se você realmente quer saber

Quando estou longe de você
Fico mais feliz do que nunca
Gostaria de poder explicar melhor
Queria que não fosse verdade

Você me liga de novo, bêbado em sua Mercedes
Dirigindo para casa embriagado
Você me matou de susto, mas estou falando tudo isso à toa
Porque você só escuta seus malditos amigos

Eu não me identifico com você
Eu não me identifico com você, não
Porque eu nunca me trataria tão mal
Você me fez odiar esta cidade

E eu não falo merda sobre você na internet
Nunca disse nada de ruim a ninguém
Porque essa merda é constrangedora, você era tudo para mim
E tudo o que você fez foi me deixar triste pra caralho

Então não desperdice o tempo que eu não tenho
E não tente fazer com que eu me sinta mal

Eu poderia falar sobre todas as vezes que você apareceu na hora certa
Mas eu teria uma linha vazia, porque isso nunca aconteceu
Nunca ligou pra minha mãe ou meus amigos, então eu
Me afastei de todos eles por você, porque eu era uma criança

Você estragou tudo que era bom
Sempre disse que ninguém te entendia
Transformou todos os meus momentos em seus
Apenas me deixe em paz, porra

"Happier Than Ever 

Billie Eilish
When I'm away from you, I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mmm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue? (My avenue)
When you (when you) said you were passing through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (when I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was telling you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (what you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable
So if you really wanna know
When I'm away from you (when I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true (wish it wasn't true), mmm-hmm
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Driving home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wasting my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fucking friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fucking sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends
So I shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fucking leave me alone

"Here is an analysis of the music video I made real quick, hope it was informative:

There are two locations here: (0:00) The golden house and (2:50) the submerged rooftop. 0:00 - The golden house is very weird to me: it’s peaceful, completely devoid of conflict. Many people in abusive relationships may avoid conflict simply because they are scared. Abuse victims do not avoid conflict because they are happy at the moment, they most likely hate the situation they are in. No, they avoid conflict because they often believe the abuser is in the right and is doing nothing wrong.

Billie in the golden house seems to be depressed. She expresses little emotion. A complete opposite to the area around her, which is glamorous and extravagant. Abuse victims sacrifice happiness for their relationship situation to stay the same. Remember, many of them think, “It isn’t him/her, it’s me.” So, they remain in their relationship, (which they are supposed to be loving) and become depressed. Much like Billie in the golden house. The golden house has no conflict, but Billie is depressed anyway.

She thinks it’s great, she is supposed to be feeling good, but she isn’t. She is numb. Hopeless. She’s convinced herself the house is good, but she isn’t enjoying it. She’s convinced herself the relationship is good, but isn’t enjoying it. “Why am I not enjoying this house? It must be my fault” ” “Why am I not enjoying this relationship? It must be my fault.

2:01 - 2:27: It isn’t until the door crashes open with water, resembling being crashed with the realization of your partner being the fault in the relationship.

She reaches the rooftop, and sees how bad the world (relationship) she is living in is. She sees the rain, the abyss surrounding her, and the lack of exit. This all resembles her character finally leaving the golden house, (the stage of denial or believing your partner is in the right in the relationship and you are in the wrong) and seeing how messed up her relationship is. She finally understands where she is really living in. She is living in an abusive relationship.

4:00: Is a beautiful moment. It shows her character happy, she finally understands why the relationship felt horrible to her. It was the abusive partner the entire time. She’s smiling because she understands, and can move on and hopefully find someone better.

4:40: The ending can be interpreted multiple ways: (1) Her going back into the Golden House is representative of her falling back into the abusive relationship. If the Golden House is representative of peaceful depression and denying your partners toxicity, her falling back into the water could mean she is going back down into the Golden House. I find this unlikely. This songs message seems to be about the realization and breakaway from the abusive relationship: with the heavy rock section seeming to exemplify freedom rather than being stuck to abuse and manipulation. Long, grossing cords rather than tight and restrained ones. She also smiles right before she goes under the water, as seen in 4:47

Or it could mean (2) that she will go back to the Golden House, but will have someone to make her happy. The House itself represents relationships, and maybe if she has the right person with her on the phone, she can finally enjoy it. Maybe then, she won’t have to be away from her partner to feel Happier Than Ever.

Thank you Billie. This is easily your best song and music video.",0.5855,Positive,0.1240481552981552,Neutral,-0.3423146605491638,Negative

"Lyrics 🍃🌺

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

Give me a day or two
To think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do

Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passing through
Was I even on your way?

I knew when I asked you to
Be cool about what I was telling you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do
And I'd end up more afraid

Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly weren't aware that you
Made me miserable
So if you really wanna know

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Driving home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wasting my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fucking friends

I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fucking sad

So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad

I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fucking leave me alone",-0.9812,Negative,-0.0511904761904761,Negative,-0.6003926992416382,Negative

"John 3:16
[16]For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

Luke 13:3
[3]I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.

John 14:6
[6]Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

Matthew 18:11 
For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.

John 8:12
[12]Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. 

Matthew 4:17
 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

Romans 10:9 
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

Romans 10:13
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. 

Luke 6:27-38
But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, 
6:28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you. 
6:29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also. 
6:30 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again. 
6:31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise. 
6:32 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them. 
6:33 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same. 
6:34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again. 
6:35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil. 
6:36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. 
6:37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: 
6:38 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.


Ephesians 2:8-9
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
Not of works, lest any man should boast.

2 Chronicles 7:14
If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.

Matthew 5:2-12
King James Version
2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,
3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.
10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.

Matthew 24:4-14 
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.
24:5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.
24:6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
24:7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
24:8 All these are the beginning of sorrows.
24:9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
24:10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
24:11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
24:12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.
24:13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.


Exodus 20
King James Version
20 And God spake all these words, saying,

2 I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.

5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;

6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.

7 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:

10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:

11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.

13 Thou shalt not kill.

14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.

15 Thou shalt not steal.

16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.

"When I’m away from you
I’m happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn’t true

Give me a day or two
To think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do

Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passing through
Was I even on your way?

I knew when I asked you to be cool
About what I was telling you
You’d do the opposite of what you said you’d do
And I’d end up more afraid

Don’t say it isn’t fair
You clearly weren’t aware
That you made me miserable
So if you really want to know...

When I’m away from you
I’m happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn’t true

You call me again
Drunk in your Benz
Driving home under the influence
You scared me to death
But I’m wasting my breath
Because you only listen to your fu**ing friends

I don’t relate to you
I don’t relate to you, no
Because I’d never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don’t talk s*it about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
Because that s*it is embarrassing
You were my everything
And all that you did was make me fu**ing sad

So don’t waste the time I don’t have
And don’t try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time
That you showed up on time
But I’d have an empty line
Because you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends
So I shut them all out for you
Because I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fu**ing leave me alone

Billie Eilish - Happier than ever

"Can't an open and sincere heart whisper sweetness
That to another open and sincere heart ?
Or does it not cry out in pain ?
Doesn't it cry out with pain inside 
As well as outside ?
But isn't every heart unique ? 
Isn't it free to open up ?
And to be true too ?
Hence, isn't love a hell of a risk to take ?
For the heart of the other is hidden
Moreover it is not perfect
Even if it is open and true.
But this existence without love ?
And without forgiveness in return ?
What about it ?
So
Cheer up Billie...

Un cœur ouvert et sincère ne peut-il pas murmurer de douceur
qu'à un autre cœur ouvert et sincère ?
Ou ne crie-t-il pas sa douleur ?
Ne hurle-t-il alors pas de douleur à l'intérieur 
Comme à l'extérieur d'ailleurs ?
Mais chaque cœur n'est-il pas unique ? 
N'est-il pas libre de s'ouvrir ?
Et d'être vrai aussi ?
Par conséquent, l'amour n'est-il pas un sacré risque à courir ?
Car le cœur de l'autre est caché
De plus il n'est pas parfait
Même s'il est ouvert et vrai.
Mais cette existence sans amour ?
Et sans pardon en retour ?
Qu'en est-il ?
Alors
Courage Billie...

"When I'm away from you, I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true, hm
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mmm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue? (My avenue)
When you (when you) said you were passing through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (when I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was telling you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (what you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable
So if you really wanna know
When I'm away from you (when I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true (wish it wasn't true), mmm-hmm
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Driving home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wasting my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fucking friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fucking sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends
So I shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fucking leave me alone",-0.9776,Negative,-0.0194444444444444,Negative,-0.615230917930603,Negative
