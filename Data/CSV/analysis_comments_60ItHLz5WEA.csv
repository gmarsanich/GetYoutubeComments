Afraid our aim is out of sight

These shallow waters never met what I needed
I'm letting go
A deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing
Alive

Where are you now?

Under the bright
But faded lights
You set my heart on fire
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Where are you now?
Atlantis
Under the sea
