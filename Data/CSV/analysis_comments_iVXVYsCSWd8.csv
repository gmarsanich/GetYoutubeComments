"Dear WWE. 

On behalf of everybody I think watching, most of the current roster theme songs are so bland, boring, repetitive and interchangable that we all truly feel like Michael Cole with: ""What? Could it be? It can't!"" because at this point we can't discern whos music is playing. This was also most true at this years royal rumble. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!. Add a single lyric to any of these peoples theme songs for the love of mankind.
