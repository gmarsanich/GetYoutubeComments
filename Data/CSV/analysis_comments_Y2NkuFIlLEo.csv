"I lost my great grandfather 5 years ago, he passed away at the age of 103. I heard the message that he had passed away from my parents at the first day of the high  school  midterm. After that moment, after the funeral, afterwards, all along I've been constantly convincing myself that it's natural, ""people would eventually pass away"", so don't cry, don't be dramatically saying how I miss him or something. But upon hearing this song, it instantly untied the knot. I realized deep down I actually miss him so very much and recall the memory when I heard the message. My first reaction was ""It can't be. One more week, no, one more day, after the midterm, I'll go straight to your place to visit you one last time.""

"Lyrics:
Days pass by and my eyes stay dry and I think that I'm okay
'Til I find myself in conversation fading away
The way you smile
The way you walk
The time you took
To teach me all that you had taught
Tell me how am I supposed to move on
These days I'm becoming everything that I hate wishing you were around
But now it's too late
My mind is a place that can't escape
Your ghost

Sometimes I wish that i could wish it all away-ay-ay, one more rainy day without you
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day, one more rainy day

Oh I'm a wreck without you here
Yeah I'm a wreck since you've been gone
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think was wrecked all along
Yeah I'm a wreck (wreck, wreck, wreck, wreck)

They say that the time will heal and the pain will go away
But everything it reminds me of you and it comes in waves
The way you laugh
And your shoulders shook
The time you took
To teach me all that you had taught
Tell me how am I supposed to move on
These days I'm becoming everything that I hate wishing you were around
But now it's too late
My mind is a place that can't escape
Your ghost

Sometimes I wish that i could wish it all away-ay-ay, one more rainy day without you
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day, one more rainy day

Oh I'm a wreck without you here
Yeah I'm a wreck since you've been gone
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think was wrecked all along

These days when I'm on the brink of the edge
I remember the words that you said
""Remember the life you led""
You'd say ""oh suck it all up don't get stuck in the mud
Thinking of things that you should have done""
I'll see you again my loved one
I'll see you again my loved one
Yeah I'm a wreck (wreck, wreck, wreck)
I'll see you again my loved one (I'll see you again my loved one)
Oh I'm a wreck without you here
(I'm a wreck)
Yeah I'm a wreck since you been gone
(I'm a wreck) (since you've been gone)
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think was wrecked all along
Yeah I'm a wreck

For me, who is only a kid that is barely 11 years old, this is a lot to go through. All we can do is close our eyes and watch the memories go by. As I grow up I lose some and that's how it will be. Just know that we will all meet up in the end, with our loved ones and the ones we are close too. We may even meet up with each other.

Earned money doing hard work.  Never enjoyed them with his own earn money. My goal was to make him proud. Every I checked his pressure and diabetic level and always took care. My goal my dream everything shuttered down on 18th february 2022. 3-4 years I also never enjoyed anything and even any festival just prayed nothing happen to him and my mom. When almost he was wining and everything turning into good He had to fight with that covid virus.  Took him a little late to hospital and that happened.

Sending this out into the universe, until we meet again, my heart will ache…the aura of you is entrenched within my everything but its ok as that is how I’ll be sure it’s you even if the body is unfamiliar, I know I’ll still recognize “you”.

"On February 24, Russia went to war against Ukraine. He is shelling the entire territory of Ukraine, from east to west, firing ballistic missiles from the territory of Belarus, and shelling Kherson, Odessa, and Mykolayiv from the Crimea. They captured the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. They want to capture the capital of Ukraine, Kyiv. They also fire on residential areas. Many civilians have already died, including children. We need the world to know that Russia has started a war with Ukraine, no one is helping us, neither America nor Europe, everyone is afraid that Putin will start a nuclear war.
