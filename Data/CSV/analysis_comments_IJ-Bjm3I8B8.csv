Every look he did was absolutely stunning but something that I would have changed about the Spider-Man one would be adding a white eyelash in the white eye because being able to see the dark natural eyelash isn’t very flattering compared to the whole look.

I mean I can't tell you how bad makeup choices are here in India yesterday I just put an eyeliner and went on for the marriage ceremony but everyone was staring at me. I was like what is happening do i am looking too good? But when I showed my mom that I did the eyeliner for the first time she hated it. I thought that prolly it's just that it's my first time but actually it was not just that. she didn't like it because according to her the eyeliner should be very thin and almost without a wing. I was like wooh do everyone was lookin at me because they found it unusual with a wind and a thick liner?😯 I also checked online that what was actually wrong with it. There was merely a problem which would make a person feel that I look hilarious,-0.7073,Negative,-0.1409615384615384,Negative,-0.4388408064842224,Negative
