"¡Ay!
Fonsi, DY
Oh, oh no, oh no (oh)
Hey yeah
Diridiri, dirididi Daddy
Go!
Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (DY)
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy
Oh, tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (oh yeah)
Ya, ya me estás gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito (sube, sube, sube)
(Sube, sube) Oh
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo (uh oh, uh oh)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (uh oh, uh oh)
Tus lugares favoritos (favoritos, favoritos baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (uh oh, uh oh)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (uh oh, uh oh)
Y que olvides tu apellido (dirididi Daddy)
Yo sé que estás pensándolo (eh)
Llevo tiempo intentándolo (eh)
Mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bam bam
Sabe que esa beba 'tá buscando de mi bam bam
Ven prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamo' lento, después salvaje
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito (oh oh)
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas (oh no)
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza (slow, oh yeah)
Despacito (yeh, yo)
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito (yo)
Deja que te diga cosas al oído (yo)
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito (yeh)
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito (sube, sube, sube)
(Sube, sube) Oh
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo (uh oh, uh oh)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (uh oh, uh oh)
Tus lugares favoritos (favoritos, favoritos baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (uh oh, uh oh)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (uh oh, uh oh)
Y que olvides tu apellido
Despacito
Vamo' a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico
Hasta que las olas griten ""Ay, bendito""
Para que mi sello se quede contigo (báilalo)
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito (hey yeah, yeah)
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito (oh no)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (uh oh, uh oh)
Tus lugares favoritos (favoritos, favoritos baby)
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos (eh-oh) (Fonsi)

It was a good song of mine at the time. Well, yeah. We were 6 and 5 but.. to all the people who knows the real lyrics, wow. Just wow.

"Translated lyrics: Oh, ¡Fonsi! D.Y.! Ohhh, oh no, oh no, oh Dididiri Daddy, go!

Hey, yeah!

Yes, you know I've been looking at you for a while now I have to dance with you today (D.Y.!) I saw that your look was already calling me Show me the way I'm going

¡Oh!

You, you are the magnet and I am the metal

I'm getting closer and I'm putting together the plan

Only with thought the pulse quickens (oh, yeah!)

Ya, ya I'm liking it more than usual All my senses are asking for more

This must be taken without any hurry

Slowly

I want to breathe your neck slowly

Let me whisper things in your ear So that you remember if you're not with me Slowly I want to breathe your neck slowly

Let me tell you things in my ear

So that you remember if you are not with me

I want to undress you with kisses slowly

Slowly I sign on the walls of your labyrinth And make your body a whole manuscript

(Go up, go up, go up, go up, go up)

I want to see your hair dance, I want to be your rhythm (whoa,

whoa)

That you teach my mouth (woah, woah)

Your favorite places (favorite, favorite, baby) Let me get past your danger zones (whoa, whoa)

Until you provoke your screams (whoa, whoa) And that you forget your last name

If I ask you for a kiss, come, give it to me, I know you are

thinking

I've been trying for a long time, mommy, this is giving and

giving it

You know that your heart with me makes you bang-bang You know that that baby is looking for my bang-bang Come, try my mouth to see how it tastes to you Come, taste my mouth to see how it tastes for you I want, I want, I want to see how much love you have for you I'm not in a hurry, I want to take the trip Let's start slow, then wild

Little by little, softly softly We stick together, little by little When you kiss me with that dexterity I see that you are malicious with delicacy We stick together, little by little And that beauty is a puzzle But here I have the piece for assembly! Hears!

Step by step, soft soft

Slowly

I want to breathe your neck slowly

Let me tell you things in my ear

So that you remember if you are not with me Slowly I sign on the walls of your labyrinth And make your body a whole manuscript

I want to undress you with kisses slowly

I want to see your hair dance, I want to be your rhythm I want to see your hair dance, I want to be your rhythm That you show my mouth Your favorite places (favorite, favorite, baby) Let me surpass your danger zones

Until you provoke your screams and you forget your last name

Slowly

Let's do it on a beach in Puerto Rico Until the waves shout ""Ay, Bendito!"" So that my seal stays with you Dance it!

Fonsi, DY
Oh, oh no, oh no (oh)
Hey yeah
Diridiri, dirididi Daddy
Go!

Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (DY)
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy

Oh, tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (oh yeah)

Ya, ya me estás gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito (sube, sube, sube)
(Sube, sube) Oh

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo (uh oh, uh oh)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (uh oh, uh oh)
Tus lugares favoritos (favoritos, favoritos baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (uh oh, uh oh)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (uh oh, uh oh)
Y que olvides tu apellido (dirididi Daddy)

Yo sé que estás pensándolo (eh)
Llevo tiempo intentándolo (eh)
Mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bam bam
Sabe que esa beba 'tá buscando de mi bam bam
Ven prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamo' lento, después salvaje

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito (oh oh)
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas (oh no)
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza (slow, oh yeah)

"Some of the words in the song are familiar to me because The Philippines was a former Spanish colony (1565-1898). Too bad Spanish language was abolished in The Philippines during the late 80s, only Chavacano (Spanish-creole language spoken in Zamboanga City; Cavite City, Cavite Province & Ternate, Cavite Province) still exist. Hope to revive the Spanish language in The Philippines. Some of the words in the song are the following: 

cuello (Spanish) - kuwelyo (Filipino) meaning neck, collar.

favorito (Spanish) - paborito (Filipino) meaning favorite. 

apellido (Spanish) - apelyido (Filipino) meaning last name or surname.

tiempo (Spanish) - tiyempo (Filipino) meaning time, timing.

viaje (Spanish) - biyahe (Filipino) meaning trip, travel, voyage.

salvaje (Spanish) - salbahe (Filipino) meaning wild, naughty, abusive. 

malicia (Spanish) - malisya (Filipino) meaning malice. 

pieza (Spanish) - piyesa (Filipino) meaning piece. 

lugares (plural Spanish meaning places) - mga lugar (plural Filipino meaning places) originated from Spanish singular word lugar. 

peligro (Spanish and Chavacano/Filipino) meaning danger, peril.

delicadeza (Spanish meaning delicacy/delicate) - delikadesa (Filipino meaning values)

sentido (Spanish meaning sense) - sentido (Filipino meaning temple anatomy)",-0.5859,Negative,-0.0067307692307692,Negative,0.3280270397663116,Neutral

"Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (DY)
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy

Oh, tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (oh yeah)

Ya, ya me estás gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito (sube, sube, sube)
(Sube, sube) Oh

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo (uh oh, uh oh)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (uh oh, uh oh)
Tus lugares favoritos (favoritos, favoritos baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (uh oh, uh oh)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (uh oh, uh oh)
Y que olvides tu apellido (dirididi Daddy)

Yo sé que estás pensándolo (eh)

Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bam bam
Sabe que esa beba 'tá buscando de mi bam bam
Ven prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamo' lento, después salvaje

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito (oh oh)
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas (oh no)
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza (slow, oh yeah)

Despacito
Vamo' a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico
Hasta que las olas griten ""Ay, bendito""
Para que mi sello se quede contigo (báilalo)

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito (hey yeah, yeah)
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito (oh no)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (uh oh, uh oh)

Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (DY) 

I saw that your look was already calling me 
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome 

Show me the way that I'm going
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy

Oh you, you are the magnet and I am the metal 
Oh, tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal 

I'm getting closer and I'm putting together the plan

Just thinking about it accelerates the pulse (oh yeah)
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (oh yeah)

Slowly 
Despacito 

I want to undress you with kisses slowly 
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito 

Sign the walls of your labyrinth

You know that your heart with me makes you bam bam

We started' slow, then wild
Empezamo' lento, después salvaje

Step by step, soft soft 
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito 

We are going to stick a little bit 
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito 

When you kiss me with that skill 
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza 

I see that you are malice with finesse 
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza

"Despacito english lyrics

Yes, you know that I’ve been looking at you for a long time
I must dance with you today (DY)

(Daddy Yankee)

I saw that the look in your eyes was calling me
Show me the path that I will take (Oh)

(Luis Fonsi)

You, you’re the magnet and I’m the metal
I am getting closer and making a plan
Simply thinking about it makes my heart race (Oh yeah)

(Daddy Yankee)
Now, I’m already liking it more than usual
All of my senses are asking for more
We cannot do this in a rush
(Luis Fonsi)

Slowly
I want to breathe in your neck slowly
Let me murmur things in your ear
So that you remember if you’re not with me

Slowly
I want to undress you in kisses slowly
Firmly in the walls of your labyrinth
And of your body, I want to create a manuscript

Up, up

Up, up, up

I want to see your hair dance
I want to be your rhythm
Want you to show my mouth
Your favorite places (Favorite, favorite baby)

Let me trespass your danger zones
Until I make you scream
And you forget your last name

(Daddy Yankee)

If I ask for a kiss come give it to me
I know that you’re thinking about it
I’ve been trying to do it for awhile
Mami this is giving and giving it to you
You know that with me your heart goes bom bom
You know that from me that babe is looking for a bom bom
Come try my mouth and see if you like its taste
I want to see how much love fits in you
I’m not in a rush I want to experience this trip

Let’s start slowly, then savagely

Step by step, soft then softly
We come up against each other, little by little
When you kiss me in that state of distress
I see that you are malice and delicacy

Step by step, soft then softly
We come up against each other, little by little
And it’s just that your beauty is a puzzle
But to finish it here I have the missing piece

(Luis Fonsi)

Slowly
I want to breathe in your neck slowly
Let me murmur things in your ear
So that you remember if you’re not with me
Slowly
I want to undress you in kisses slowly
Firmly in the walls of your labyrinth
And of your body, I want to create a manuscript

Up, up, up, up

I want to see your hair dance
I want to be your rhythm
Want you to show my mouth

Your favorite places (Favorite, favorite baby)

Let me trespass your danger zones
Until I make you scream
And you forget your last name

Slowly
We’re gonna do it on a beach in Puerto Rico
Until the waves scream Oh Lord
So that my seal stays with you

(Daddy Yankee)

Step by step, soft then softly
We come up against each other, little by little

(Luis Fonsi)

I want you to show my mouth
Your favorite places (Favorite, favorite baby)

(Daddy Yankee)

Step by step, soft then softly
We come up against each other, little by little

(Luis Fonsi)

Until I make you scream
And you forget your last name

Yes, you knows that I've been looking at you for a while
I have to dance with you today
I saw,that your look was calling me
Show me the way that I'm going oh
You,You are the manget and I'm the metal
I'm getting closer and setting up the plan
Just the thought of it accelerates the pulse
Now I'm enjoying it more than usual
All my senses are asking for more
This must be taken with any trouble
*Slowly*
I want to breathe your neck slowly
Turn it up x5
I wanna see you dance
I wanna be your rhythm
I want you to show me
Your favorite places(favorite favorite baby)
Let me surpass your danger zones
To make you scream
And forget your name
If I ask you for a kiss,come give it to me,
I know that you are thinking about it
I've been trying for some time,
Mommy this is giving and giving it
You know that your heart with me makes you bom bom
You know that this baby is looking for my bom bom
Come test my mouth to see what it taste like to you
I want to see how much love do you have
I'm not in a hurry,
I want to do the trip
Let's start slowly then wildly
Step by step,
Soft softly,
We are going to get caught,
Little by little
When you kiss me so skillfully
I think that you're malicious delicately
Step by step,
Soft softly,
We are going to get caught
Little by little
And it's just that this beauty is a puzzle
But to put it together here I have the pieces
*Slowly*
I want to breathe your neck slowly
Let me tell you things in your ears
So that you remember when you're not with me
*Slowly*
I want to strip you off with kisses slowly
Sign the walls of your labyrinth
And make your whole body a manuscript
Turn it up x5
I wanna see you dance,
I wanna be your rhythm
I want you to show me
Your Favorite places (favorite favorite baby)
Let me surpass your danger zones
To make you scream
And forget your name
*Slowly*
We will do it on the beach in Puerto Rico
Till the waves scream dear god
So that my seal stays with you
Step by step,
Soft softly,
We are going to get caught,
Little by little
I want you to show me

Fonsi, DY
Oh, oh no, oh no (oh)
Hey yeah
Diridiri, dirididi Daddy
Go!
Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (DY)
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy
Oh, tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (oh yeah)
Ya, ya me estás gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito (sube, sube, sube)
(Sube, sube) Oh
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo (uh oh, uh oh)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (uh oh, uh oh)
Tus lugares favoritos (favoritos, favoritos baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (uh oh, uh oh)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (uh oh, uh oh)
Y que olvides tu apellido (dirididi Daddy)
Yo sé que estás pensándolo (eh)
Llevo tiempo intentándolo (eh)
Mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bam bam
Sabe que esa beba 'tá buscando de mi bam bam
Ven prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamo' lento, después salvaje
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito (oh oh)
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas (oh no)
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza (slow, oh yeah)
Despacito (yeh, yo)
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito (yo)
Deja que te diga cosas al oído (yo)
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito (yeh)
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto 
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito (sube, sube, sube)
(Sube, sube) Oh
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo (uh oh, uh oh)

Tus lugares favoritos (favoritos, favoritos baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (uh oh, uh oh)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (uh oh, uh oh)
Y que olvides tu apellido
Despacito
Vamo' a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico
Hasta que las olas griten ""Ay, bendito""
Para que mi sello se quede contigo (báilalo)
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito (hey yeah, yeah)
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito (oh no)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (uh oh, uh oh)
Tus lugares favoritos (favoritos, favoritos baby)
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito

"Lyrics 
¡Ay!
Fonsi, DY
Oh, oh no, oh no (oh)
Hey yeah
Diridiri, dirididi Daddy
Go!

Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (DY)
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy

Oh, tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (oh yeah)

Ya, ya me estás gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito (sube, sube, sube)
(Sube, sube) Oh

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo (uh oh, uh oh)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (uh oh, uh oh)
Tus lugares favoritos (favoritos, favoritos baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (uh oh, uh oh)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (uh oh, uh oh)
Y que olvides tu apellido (dirididi Daddy)

Yo sé que estás pensándolo (eh)
Llevo tiempo intentándolo (eh)
Mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bam bam
Sabe que esa beba 'tá buscando de mi bam bam
Ven prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamo' lento, después salvaje

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito (oh oh)
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas (oh no)
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza (slow, oh yeah)

Despacito (yeh, yo)
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito (yo)
Deja que te diga cosas al oído (yo)
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito (yeh)
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito (sube, sube, sube)
(Sube, sube) Oh

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo (uh oh, uh oh)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (uh oh, uh oh)
Tus lugares favoritos (favoritos, favoritos baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (uh oh, uh oh)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (uh oh, uh oh)
Y que olvides tu apellido

Despacito
Vamo' a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico
Hasta que las olas griten ""Ay, bendito""
Para que mi sello se quede contigo (báilalo)

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito (hey yeah, yeah)
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito (oh no)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (uh oh, uh oh)
Tus lugares favoritos (favoritos, favoritos baby)
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos (eh-oh) (Fonsi)

"beter ver:Enderdragon in my direction
Many XP it's such a blessing, yeah
Use all the XP to enchant my armor, yeah
Oh-oh, I
Try to sleep on the darkest day
But the mobs are in the way
Gotta kill them so I can go to bed (bed)
This armor's really comfy when I put it on
Change it to peaceful so I'm not killed when I spawn
I see a village that is near
The only sounds I wanna hear
Are the villagers when I trade them some gear
Smelt the iron so I can get some metal
Make an Iron Pickaxe to mine the rare ores
You know that I gotta mine all these diamonds
Oh yeah (yeah)
Need alot of food on this hard adventure
Should I cook the pig or the cow?
I'm not sure
Maybe I should make a cake for my hunger
Minecraftcito
Where you need to survive all day and all night
Craft a diamond sword so you can fight
Place a torch in a cave to produce some light
Minecraftcito
Kill the creeper before it blows my house
But it blew up so I gotta move out
Don't have food so I'm fishing to catch a trout
Killing people in Hunger Games to get the victory
Trolling people on some servers
Lava their house 'cause I'm a griefer
(I'm a griefer, I'm a griefer baby)
Taming wolves with my bones 'cause I need lots of help
When these mobs try to kill me
My doggies can attack them
To make survival you need armor bro
A pickaxe and a wooden how
Diamond sword but do not show
Don't flex on these haters bro
Make a farm and a house so creepers won't kill you
Go to the nether but don't hit pigmen
They will kill you
Get a lot of blaze powder and make the Eye of Ender
Find the Ender portal and put the eyes in the frames
After that, grab your bow and diamond sword
Yeah, don't hide that
You are one step away from completing Minecraft
Exploring, exploring
To some other biomes
We're at another place
Changing up the timezones
See a witch in a swamp
Ocelot on top
Of a tree I'm gonna feed it some fish
Exploring, exploring
To some other biomes
We're at another place
Changing up the timezones
Use a boat to travel to different places
Skeletons attacking me
Gotta make a base oh, yeah
