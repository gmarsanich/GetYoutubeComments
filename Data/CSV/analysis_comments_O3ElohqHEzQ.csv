As well as All Falls Down.

Btw, would you be so kind to explain why in the Darkside song singer (either in this album or in Aviation movie) pronounce this word as something like 'darkshide'. At the same time in Aviation movie singer AU/RA pronounce this word clean. I don't mind about this 'darkshide', it is even cute from some point of view, but interesting why.
