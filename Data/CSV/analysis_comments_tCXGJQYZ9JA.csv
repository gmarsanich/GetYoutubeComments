"It’s my favourite song and I can’t stop listenning to this. Delicate is always at the top of my playlist on spotify. The MV is so satisfiying and bewitching with this incredible, iconic dance. This song gets better after every listen. It sounds differently and makes me feel different things every time. Sometimes i think of the boy I love but who doesn’t love me, because he just wants me to be his friend and the situation is ”delicate” and sometimes it just releases me from my emotions. I’m writting a book and the ”isn’t” of the second chorus is the momenf that inspired me for the ”kiss under the rain on a friday night at 11 P.M.” scene which marks a new turning point in the history. 
I know i’m just telling my life and you don’t care about it but I had to say it.
