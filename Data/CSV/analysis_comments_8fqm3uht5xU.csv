"Hey! I'm actually spanish and I must day that the first game was really good at representing that scenario. The architecture of the house, the references to actual spanish brands like Colacao and the historical references to the Civil War and Franco's goberment are really well made and that gets my respects. Dont know if the person or group responsable of it is spanish or has anything to do with the country, bit seriusly: really good stuff.
Edit: figured out the developer is spanish 👍",0.839,Positive,0.1318181818181818,Neutral,0.3300444185733795,Positive
