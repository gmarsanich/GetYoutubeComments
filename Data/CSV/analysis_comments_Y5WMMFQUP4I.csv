"Romans 3:23 states: ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."". Romans 10:13 states ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."". 

   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.",-0.9954,Negative,0.0862179487179487,Positive,0.6152694225311279,Positive

"EEAS Official: Human Rights Is a Must, not Optional

Dominic Porter from EEAS called in to the meeting online.

Dominic Porter from the European External Action Service (EEAS), an agency connected with the foreign and defense ministry of the EU, also called in to the meeting online. As head of the division responsible for China, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and Mongolia, he said the EEAS is seriously concerned about the organ harvesting in China.

Porter noted that the hearing attendees had heard many findings from various investigations, including disturbing allegations ranging from sexual abuse, torture, DNA testing, and illegal detention to organ harvesting in China. More and more evidence collected has shown that Falun Gong practitioners, minority ethnic groups, and faith groups in China are being persecuted in China.

Porter also said that the EU strongly condemned the crime of organ harvesting in China because it is inhumane and immoral. Respect for human rights is not optional, it is a basic requirement that we should all follow, including in the field of organ donation and organ transplantation. He emphasized that human rights conditions will continue to be a focal point at multilateral forums for EU human rights actions.",-0.9643,Negative,0.0226190476190476,Positive,0.2828428149223327,Neutral

3: how convinient that the builders knew he had a shovel (that made the prison)

4: he could have give his friend the bow and the arrow he traded so he could hit the target

5: it would take long but he could have broke the obsidian in the room he placed the dirt to check any chests hoppers or stuff like that

6: (i forgot the start) he could have used f5 instead of looking for wood

So it's got bedrock so they can physically not escape because that's the only way to make it impossible or throw them in the middle of the void with no way to get out that could work or strand them at the top of the nether there's nothing that they can do up there or trap them in a box with mining fatigue and a piston system that ticks off every once in a while that pushes them breaking their current focus on the item that they're looking at so that way they physically cannot break out and it can be glass so that way you can just stand there and stare at them that's how you can't get out of place because the piston keeps on moving you so that way you can never have the proper angle and if the person thinks that I'll just be smart and hit it blocked the piston is pushing me at you have a backup piston that pushes another Block in front of that one and quickly goes away whenever the first piston goes off,-0.7592,Negative,0.0573593073593073,Positive,-0.414905309677124,Negative
