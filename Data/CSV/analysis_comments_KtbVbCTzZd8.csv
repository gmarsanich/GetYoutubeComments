Biggest thing I picked up on was the missing slide moves when he says ""I don't know"" repeatedly.  Another thing I wanted to mention was that I can't seem to enjoy his songs anymore.

"Hi all! My name is Maria, I live in Kyiv.
All my life I lived calmly and did not suspect that in 2022 a massive military invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation would begin😱
Now there is a massive shelling of peaceful houses, high-rise buildings, offices, apartments.
Innocent people are dying, civilians are suffering, women, children are being killed, raped, why do we need all this? what have we done that they do this to us?

Russian soldiers cannot defeat our army and they run away from hopelessness 🙈 or shoot at civilians
Russia is an aggressor and this is not a special operation, but a full-scale invasion (WAR)

In this difficult time, many people who have the opportunity to leave the country, left, BUT a very large part remained and do not have such an opportunity =(((
Now the Russian military is blowing up bridges so that Ukrainians would not be able to leave their cities, regions and the country as a whole, due to the fact that many bridges have been blown up, this makes it difficult to deliver food, medicine, clothing to the occupied cities and regions.

Therefore, I ask you not to stand aside in such a difficult time for us, I CALL on all those who are not indifferent to help UKRAINE, whoever can, even $ 1 can help, because there are a lot of good people in the world and I really believe in it.

I know guys VOLUNTEERS who collect humanitarian aid, below I will attach all sorts of details.

Michael Jackson defined pop, cool, hip, tolerance, love and inclusion for DECADES. The world is literally worse off with him no longer in it.

Was the sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment

"*WW2 like war being started to hide WW2 like genocide.  Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and now ​a corona virus pandemic. Corona means crown, and a virus attacking the crown/government is some thing exposing government (2Corinthians4:4).  Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 can only apply to one place on earth.  Research it well to learn who has been behind slaughters for centuries!*   1John5:19 is trying to stop Daniel12:4,2:44,45.  Hitler was an unexcommunicated Catholic.  Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 is orchestrating this assault against humanity, but they are trying to blame it on innocent peoples, Countries and groups.  *Hitler rounded up to go to concentration camps because of a supposed typhus epidemic, and were gassed on the way by vehicle exhaust, or by zyklon B rodent extermination gas.* (h#$%@3n)cyanide.  *Most were dead with in 70 days of being picked up.*  Canada shut down a government minister on a Parliamentary broadcast for inquiring about their concentration camps. 
*Revelation mentions that people should leave the Revelation18:4 group if they don't want to receive her plagues.  (Hello, if you don't want to receive her plagues!)* 
​According to Revelation 18 this group wears *scarlet(Cardinals),* and *purple(Bishops).*  It refers to a city Kingdom (Rome is the only city kingdom in the world), that rules over the Kings of the earth.  Where are the Kings?  The Roman Empire broke in 2 and from those 2 divisions came 10 Countries.  The Pope was the eleventh, but he got rid of 3, and from the 7 he is chosen, and there will be 10 again.  5 Countries on each leg of the Roman Empire.  The (cross or X) is on the shields(British flag, same as Roman shield) of the the Empire, and it symbolizes the ten Kingdoms, and the religious beliefs. According to official writings no one may buy or sell or say a greeting to any one who has left the cross.  The X or cross originates from the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet the tau, which means a mark, both literal and figurative.  In The Bible book of Ezekiel 9, God put a tau(mark) on the people who were crying over the loss of wickedness.  The mark was not for salvation.  Revelation/Apocalypse 13:18 says you won't be able to buy or sell with out the tau(mark) of the beast(Empire).  It is 1 of only 2 things that the Bible says gets you condemned, with no chance of repenting and being forgiven. The cross has been used through out history, including the Egyptians called it the ankh, which was a symbol of power.  The cross has falsely become associated with the Messiah(Christ), and that is where Xmass, and Christmas comes from.  Popes have always had a mitre(triple tiered crown) with 666 on it in Latin (Vicarivs Filli Dei). 
​Latin letters have a number associated with it(like a Roman clock), just like Hebrew and Greek.   Rome has called for mass destruction and sabotage to stop people from hearing this.  Government and Churches working in self interest. The earth belongs to the people collectively.  *1John**5:19** is getting people to attack the people trying to make you free.(Daniel12:4)  *Clear your browser history and cache, and YouTube search and viewing history!  Please pray for me and you!*  Their hate for Acts2:44 runs deep, and that is why Christian nations are committing genocide under the guise of a corona virus, just as Hitler did under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and falsely attacking China. *The last war China fought was WW2, and that was because they were attacked.*  Try reading your Bible and having a scrap of decency!  Study Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 deeply, as people are putting their life on the line for you!  **There is an open offer of 1000 000 dollars to any one who can prove that Rome(Pope) is not the man in the Temple that rides the Roman Empire of Revelation 17,18.  In fact, that is why it is called the ""Roman""Catholic Church.**  Idols on Ste. Peter's Basilica(Rome), show that Rome is a complete fraud (Acts15, Exodus20, Deuteronomy 5).   Revelation17,18 is framing innocent people and businesses, and are going to attempt to get people so mad they will kill their perceived enemies. Governments issue vaccine mandates all over the world.   Businesses face huge fines if they don't comply, but Revelation17,18 causes sabotage, boycotts, protests, walk outs and people quittng, so as to destroy business.  Those trying to Daniel12:4 about 1John5:19. *The Pope and the British Royals were found guilty of genocide, by the International Criminal Court, pre corona. Donald J. Trump attacked the International Criminal Court by the US financial system. (corrupt), and now trying to start war with Russia.*  Revelation/Apocalypse17,18, 1John5:19, 2Corinthians4:4 is waring against God and humanity. Not NWO Daniel 12:4, but 1John5:19 OWO.*  Same as the genocide and war of WW2, and plague of 1918?  *Think! Copy and share this information!(video record, record in audio, text, or ?*  All the things happening are to hide a Hitler like genocide.  They are attacking because of information exposing them.  ***There is two realities playing out.***  *1.* A corona virus pandemic and a vaccine to stop its spread.  *2.* Corona means crown(government) and there is a virus(information exposing/attacking the crown/government) and there is a computer/device anti virus(vaccine)(which is supposed to protect from malicious computer code) and this anti virus deletes information from your view.  *Trade your digital vaccine pass for a paper one and they lose control!  *Do it!*   They will go in to a frenzy because of this information.*  UK just passing laws to lock people up indefinitely, with no trial, take your kids, force tests, and send to concentration camps. UK has released tender for businesses to contract cadaver services for millions of human corpses.  Mass emergency poison purchase in Australia.  Hitler killed with odorless rat poison. Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 ruled the world for 1260 years. Rome was beheading for observing the real Sabbath(not ((Sun)day) ""lord's day"" lord's day is a clever imposter of the Sabbath.) *A Pope struck a coin commemorating chopping off people's heads for observing the Sabbath.  On one side of the coin was the Pope's head, and the other an Angel with a sword and a pile of heads.  Ste Bartholomew's eve massacre. In the Vatican library is the proof of the collaboration of Church and State enslavement. Urgent necessity, to make the Vatican library completely public, and every nation should vote to make all religious files over 100 years old public, or start paying taxes.*  Through history the Catholic Austrian Royals ruled Germany and the leader of the exterminations was Catholic Austrian Adolf Hitler, and most exterminations were in Catholic Poland, which is now completely militarizing including school children, and German troops are moving near Russia..  Revelation/Apocalypse17,18 eats it's children.  Determining the future by movies, is pure stupidity.  *××Every one needs a 2.5 micron air quality monitor, so you can see when you are being GASSED!xx* (Revelation13:15,18:5,*6*.)   *How could there be a vaccine for a new variant with out testing, that is not covered by previous jabs?*  G7 nations are removing corona restrictions, to regain it by war powers.*G(7) of Revelation.* Who will do the will of God? (*Revelation 18:6*)   *I've been warning for over two years that Rome would start a war with Russia and China to hide genocide.*  Roman Catholic Joe Biden stopped the natural gas pipeline in the US and now in Europe.  This is Rome's war.  *China be on guard of forces invading Taiwan, blaming you and attacking from there.*  Those attacking Russia/China, read Acts2:44,45, Daniel2:44,45, you follow Satan.  *Gog and Magog are in Turkey, Ezekiel38 not Russia.*  Mark of beast(MOB) nations hate (Bible Acts2:44,45; 4:32-35).  Ukraine sinking their own ships and blowing up their own bridges.  NATO has M.O.B. on flag, and goal is war on Acts2:44. *Pompeo says Rome planned Ukraine war for 2017.* Britian's Boris Johnson said, the pandemic is not working, so plan A, war.  Roman Christian militias killing in Ukraine.  *Putin wanted to talk before this happened. Think!*  Germany forbidden to cause genocide because of WW2 extermination, so now they turn their military over to NATO to do it, and mobilizing in Lithuania, according to German media.  *Russian news channels are being blocked in the West, to hide the truth. Free? No, duped.  Think!*  The Pope is the man of sin in the(false)temple with 666, and exterminating for generations, yet the *US although it has the largest military, is naked and prostrated gratifying her Papal master, while UK readies her turn.  Most cowardly in all history.*  I think Ukraine war was started from Poland as the Italian air force was there.  Who will obey God's Revelation18:4-8?  *I am not Russian.* So quit attacking Russia!  Canadian, US and British military found dead in Ukraine, from their involvement(many there for months). Poland the site of most WW2 exterminations is mobilizing the entire nation including school children for war, and Italian military is there.  *Roman Catholic Joe Biden says if this message doesn't stop, he'll attack Russia.  I'm not Russian.*  By the way, Ukraine's capital is a Russian word.  Boris ""Plan A"". *I helped build America up, so listen!  Rome is plotting your destruction.  She has false prophets claiming you are Babylon the Great, and not her.*  Russia didn't start it.  Why is Russia media being blocked? Corona virus disappears and British/Rome ""Plan A"" appears. Russian Ukraine are like brothers.  Rome's staging of the war is the only way to make sense of it.  NATO has the MOB on their flag and militarizing Ukraine long before the war and their goal is to destroy the Bible's Acts2:44(Russia).  Every nation should pray about helping Russia!   Decent people boycott G7!  US committed war crimes in Afghanistan, should we boycott ourselves? !(!((",-0.9998,Negative,-0.0016042005986312,Negative,-0.3023847043514251,Negative
