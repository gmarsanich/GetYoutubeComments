"Everybody knows my name now
But somethin' 'bout it still feels strange
Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself
And seein' somebody else
And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down
But it's killin' me now
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just lonely
I'm so lonely
Lonely
Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe that's the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave
They criticized the things I did as an idiot kid
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me

"He was just a kid. Once he got off stage after seeing millions of adoring fans, he was still lonely because no one truly understood how hard it is to grow up as a celebrity. Travelling all the time means he couldn’t spend time with his friends and was around adults all the time. He would have just wanted to be around kids his own age. Kids who just wanted to play and didn’t care about his fame or money. Imagine the school work while in between travelling to various parts of the world paired with jet lag and being pushed to perform ur best and even then feeling like u were obligated not just to his team but the fans to perform. I get why he acted out. He has known nothing but fame since a young age. People after his money or his body. People doing crazy things to be close to him. He can’t walk down the street without people following him or catcalling him. Imagine the fear and paranoia he lives in. Worrying about being attacked by fans or even haters everywhere he goes. This is how it’s been since he was 16. He didn’t get to live a proper childhood. He had to grow up fast. He was probably taken advantage of by adults being so young (money wise, fame wise) being so young and naïve I bet he was pushed into doing a lot of things he didn’t wanna do. Poor kid has never really had a break since before his fame. Growing up as a celebrity would have been pretty damn lonely.",-0.6207,Negative,0.1113876863876864,Positive,-0.2667912244796753,Negative

This reminded me of Andy Gibb. They thought his career was better off alone than joining the Bee Gees. He died at age 30 of a heart problem caused by prior cocaine use.

"145 million people watched and listened to this, and this song complains about how nobodies listening. Kind of ironic. That sense of desperation is so fabricated in this song. I guarantee you Justin Bieber has people he could call and people that call him. He needs to shatter the self inflicted illusion of loneliness. You're lonely? Go break bread with people, go call people, put yourself out there. Loneliness is a choice, so if you choose to be alone be happy with that decision or choose to not be lonely.",-0.8263,Negative,0.2333333333333333,Positive,-0.4298683702945709,Negative

Everybody knows my name now
But something 'bout it still feels strange
Like looking in a mirror, trying to steady yourself
And seeing somebody else

And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down
But it's killing me now

What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fucking lonely

I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely

Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe that's the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a shit
They criticized the things I did
As an idiot kid

What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me

'Cause I've had everything

"So as someone who never suffers from loneliness I would like to say I always have God who will never leave you or forsake you.
If I was the only person on earth like Adam was God would provide companionship in the other creatures he has made.  Just the very wind that lifts your hair is like a touch from God.  A winged insect stuck on his back buzzing around trying to right himself was a show that God allowed for me alone.
God cares for the sparrow, and grows the flowers so in my lifetime he is there for me each and everyday like the sun that shines upon us.

Everybody knows my name now
But somethin' 'bout it still feels strange
Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself

Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down

But somethin' 'bout it still feels strange
Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself

And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down
But it's killin' me now
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just lonely
I'm so lonely
Lonely
Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe that's the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave
They criticized the things I did as an idiot kid
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?

'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening

I am so proud of Justin he went from growing up in front of the entire world to becoming a great person. Justin is the greatest idol because he showcases his mistakes he made when he was younger but he didn't let that stop him from being the best version of himself. I am so glad he has grown with his music and is now 28. Happy Birthday legend,0.9793,Positive,0.5944444444444444,Positive,0.8574392795562744,Positive
