"Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
(Kio, Kio)

I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

Ridin' on a tractor
Lean all in my bladder
Cheated on my baby
You can go and ask her
My life is a movie
Bull ridin' and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit, diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

"Jesus Christ Saves

Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.

Jesus Christ died on the cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later to pay for the sins of mankind to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.

EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:

1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.
2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.

Biblical References:
1. Romans 5:9
2. Romans 3:23
3. Romans 6:23
4. Romans 10:9
5. Romans 10:13
6. Ephesians 2: 8 & 9
7. John 3:16

God bless you, peace be with you always. Thank you for your time.",0.8316,Positive,0.1169642857142857,Positive,0.6574028134346008,Positive

"EDDMZ EPISODE 51

LA DESCENTE AUX ENFER DE MILEY CYRUS

Intro
A elle seule, Miley représente tout les faux pas possible de la célébrité. De stars pour Ados à star Trash jusqu'à finir dans le néant et rejeté des 2 camps. Retour sur un désastre.

ÉPOQUE DISNEY
Miley est la fille de Billy Ray Cyrus. Un chanteur country très respecté dans le milieu de la musique. ( Il avait notamment été sur un des tubes de la décennie passé avec "" Old Town Road"").
Ça ouvre des portes à miley qui participe à des concours de chants ici et là et qui décroche un contract avec la célèbre chaîne Disney.
A la clé une série nommé Hannah Montana ou elle jouera le rôle d'une adolescente chanteuse vivant une double vie. La série est un carton et rapporte des millions. Le timing est donc parfait pour sortir son premier album avec notamment le titre "" Party in usa"" qui bat des records de téléchargement.

ÉPOQUE TRASH
Mais en quittant l'adolescence Miley veut également laissé derrière elle l'image lisse et tendre de son personnage de série et va s'en séparer le plus possible.
Tout change radicalement. Les textes de ses chansons sont désormais sur le sexe hard-core et les drogues sur représenté par exemple dans le titre "" We can't stop"". Elle tente également de tout faire pour se donner une image "" Street"" en se lançant dans le Rap avec le titre "" Fallin myself"" featuring will I am et wiz Khalifa.
Les concerts également se transforme en show porno de 1h30 et petit à petit les sponsors s'en vont

L'INDIFFÉRENCE
Après avoir choqué durant environ deux ans Miley à commencer à être vu comme une gimmick et ses tactiques ne surprenait plus personne. Les albums ne se vendent plus et l'image a pris un énorme coup de vieux. Elle a tenté de retourné à ses sources avec un album soft pop country mais ça ne prend plus.

CONCLUSION
Miley a voulu se séparer de son image coûte que coûte et en faisant ça elle s'est crée une image encore plus fake que sa première image",-0.9086,Negative,0.0929166666666666,Positive,-0.2794505059719085,Negative
