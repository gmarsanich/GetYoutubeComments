In the beginning of the video he explains what happened when he came to inspect the place before cleaning and found the body, he called the police to inform them and they were like ""ok but can you try poking it or calling out to it just to make sure tho"". The body was black from decay, leaking all sorts of things and stiff in rigor mortis.
