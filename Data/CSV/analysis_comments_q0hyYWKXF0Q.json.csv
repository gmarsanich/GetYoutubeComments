"My Grandpa and I love this song. I was taking care of him during his treatments.
We watched the music video together its amusing for him. Perhaps it takes his mind off from the chemo treatments.
Its maybe God will to give my Grandpa a better place next to Him and My Grandpa passed away on the same year.
I am sure my Grandpa is in good place there with my Grandma and also with God. I missed Both of Them everyday.
They had been very good to me.
Its makes me sad to hear this song.

"*WW2 like war being started to hide WW2 like genocide.  Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and now ​a corona virus pandemic.* Corona means crown, and a virus attacking the crown/government is some thing exposing government (2Corinthians4:4).  *Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 can only apply to one place on earth.  Research it well to learn who has been behind slaughters for centuries!*  1John5:19 is trying to stop Daniel12:4,2:44,45.  *Hitler was an unexcommunicated Catholic, who rounded up to go to concentration camps because of a supposed typhus epidemic, and they were gassed on the way by vehicle exhaust, or by zyklon B rodent extermination gas(h#$%@3n)cyanide. Just like Hitler started a World War to hide the genocide, so are they now.*  NATO militerizing Ukraine against Russia for a long time.  *NATO changed the capital of Ukraine from a Russian word to a new name.  The West overthrew the Russian backed government less than 10 years ago and has been killing those still loyal to Russia and calling them separatists or Russian sympathizers.* There were massive quantities of UK/US rockets and rocket launchers, which regular Catholic Ukrainians use to destroy Russian military vehicles.  *NATO calls Russia stupid for having all there tanks in a row, but they were coming in to defend, but the leader(an actor), Nazi sympathizer, is either ignorant or planned the attack.*  Does any one remember World War Two?  Same happening. *Trump said 2 years ago,""We'll soon be at war with Russia and China"". The virus disappeared, because they couldn't explain new vaccines for new variants with out testing.  To get a vaccine would be a miracle in short time, but 30 miracles in a row?  The virus wasn't able to lock you down and control you, so they are starting WW3.  Why did virus lockdown include only being able to talk to family?  To hide information.* The people of Mariopul left for Catholic Poland(the land of most WW2 exterminations of the Church of Rome's enemies). Once empty, you can see on videos that buildings are being blown up like there is carpet bombing happening, but there is no missile or rocket seen in the sky.  NATO invents the idea that Russia has supersonic missiles that go faster than you can see.  Why would Russia use such advanced weapons to destroy low value buildings?  The explosions were too big for mortar fire and in very close timing, like a controlled demolition.  *Meanwhile all the Catholics are safe in Poland, accept the civilians who stayed to use the NATO rocket launchers in surprise attack against an unsuspecting Russian column, there to protect Russian people. Military strategists say Russia was stupid and clumsy, how they just casually drove in.  That was because they weren't attacking until they were attacked by thousands of handheld missiles.  Russian media was blocked in NATO Countries(why?).  If you have the truth, there is no reason to run from information.  RT(Chinese CGTN also), was one of the Russian sources blocked.*  There was a world wide confiscation of Russian people's assets being confiscated. Russia had been asking for talks and security guarantees, but Joe said basically (@)U.  This is the same as during WW2. *You can not let the Church that rides the Roman Empire of Revelation Apocalypse 17,18, destroy Acts2:44(communism). *Most picked up for isolation, were dead with in 70 days.*  Revelation says, *leave the Revelation18:4 group if they don't want to receive her plagues.  (Hello, if you don't want to receive her plagues!)* 
​According to Revelation 18 this group wears *scarlet(Catholic Cardinals),* and *purple(Catholic Bishops).*  It refers to a city Kingdom *(Rome is the only city kingdom in the world), that rules over the Kings of the earth.*  Where are the Kings?  *The Roman Empire broke in 2 and from those 2 divisions came 10 Countries.  The Pope was the eleventh, but he got rid of 3, and from the 7 he is chosen, and there will be 10 again.*  5 Countries on each leg of the Roman Empire. *The (cross or X) is on the shields(British flag, same as Roman shield) symbolizes the ten Kingdoms(X in Latin=10), and their religious beliefs. According to official writings no one may buy or sell or say a greeting to any one who has left the cross.  The X or cross originates from the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet the tau, which means a mark, both literal and figurative.  In The Bible book of Ezekiel 9, God put a tau(mark) on the people, and it was not for salvation.  Revelation/Apocalypse **13:18** says you won't be able to buy or sell with out the tau(mark) of the beast(Empire).*  Knowingly accepting this falsehood gets you condemned. *Popes have always had a mitre(triple tiered crown) with 666 on it in Latin (Vicarivs Filli Dei).* Latin letters have a number associated with it. 1John5:19 attacking (Daniel12:4)  *Clear your browser history and cache, and YouTube search and viewing history!* Please pray for me and you!  *Study Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 deeply, as people are putting their life on the line for you!*  **There is an unclaimed open offer of 1000 000 dollars to any one who can prove that Rome(Pope) is not the man in the Temple that rides the Roman Empire of Revelation 17,18.  In fact, that is why it is called the ""Roman""Catholic Church.*  Idols on Ste. Peter's Basilica(Rome), show that Rome is a complete fraud (Acts15, Exodus20, Deuteronomy 5). *Governments mandate vaccines all over the world, which causes sabotage, boycotts, protests, walk outs and people quittng, so as to destroy businesses.*  Those trying to Daniel12:4 about 1John5:19. *The Pope and the British Royals were found guilty of genocide, by the International Criminal Court, pre corona. Donald J. Trump attacked the International Criminal Court by the US financial system.* Revelation/Apocalypse17,18, 1John5:19, 2Corinthians4:4 is waring against God and humanity. *Not NWO Daniel 12:4, but 1John**5:19** OWO. Same as the genocide and war of WW2, and plague of 1918.*  Think! *Copy and share this information!(video record, record in audio, text, or ?*  They are attacking because of information exposing them. **There are two realities playing out.**  *1.* A corona virus pandemic and a vaccine to stop its spread.  *2.* Corona means crown(government) and there is a virus(information exposing/attacking the crown/government) and there is a computer/device anti virus(vaccine)(which is supposed to protect from malicious computer code) and this anti virus deletes information from your view.(turn off antivirus software!) *Trade your digital vaccine pass for a paper one and they lose control!  Do it!  They will go in to a frenzy because of this information.*  UK just passing laws to lock people up indefinitely, with no trial, take your kids, force tests, and send to concentration camps. *UK has released tender for businesses to contract cadaver services for millions of human corpses.  Mass emergency poison purchase in Australia.  Hitler used rat poison.* Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 ruled the world for 1260 years , as Bible foretold. Rome was beheading for observing the real Sabbath(not ((Sun)day) ""lord's day"" lord's day is a clever imposter of the Sabbath.) *Catholic Austrian Royals ruled Germany and Catholic Austrian Adolf Hitler authorized most exterminations, which were in Catholic Poland, which is now completely militarizing.  Revelation/Apocalypse17,18 eats it's children.  *××Every one needs a 2.5 micron air quality monitor, so you can see when you are being GASSED!xx*(Revelation13:15,18:5,*6*.)  *G7 nations are removing corona restrictions, to regain it by war powers, or a new bird flu plan.* G(7) of Revelation. Who will do the will of God? (*Revelation 18:6*) *Think about sabotaging NATO assets for sake of the world.  They are using hand held rocket launchers, so do the same.  Quit British Pound and US dollar, use Bitcoin or other!*  I've been warning for over two years that Rome would start a war with Russia and China to hide genocide.  *Roman Catholic Joe Biden attacking Acts2:44,45, Daniel2:44,45*  Gog and Magog are in Turkey, not Russia.  *Rome hates (Acts2:44,45; 4:32-35).*  Ukraine sinking their own ships and blowing up their own bridges.  *NATO has M.O.B. on flag, and goal is war on Acts2:44.* Rome planned Ukraine war for 2017(Pompeo).  *The Pope is the man of sin in the(false)temple with 666, and exterminating for generations, yet the US although it has the largest military, is naked and prostrated gratifying her Papal master, while UK readies her turn.  The world was counting on you.  Most cowardly in all history Ukraine war was started from Poland?(Italian/US forces were there) Who will obey God's Revelation18:4-8?  *I am not Russian.*  Fact finding mission finds Russia not guilty of genocide. Multi Nation Joint forces operation in Ukraine is Rome(since 2014).  *Ukrainian Azov Battalion (Nazis) killing those with out blue arm bands. Rome is staging the entire Ukraine scenario. *This is a take over of Ukraine/war on Russia, by Rome.*  Imagine NATO Countries attacking your Country and blaming yours, so as to attack you!  *All Countries of the world formally ask NATO Nations almost 900 military bases to leave your Countries or confiscate it, for war crimes in Ukraine, Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq(ask Scott Ritter about Iraq!) etc etc etc!*  This is a global tyrannical occupation. Christian media falsely announced that Russia invaded Ukraine, to start the war and later falsely announced that China invaded Taiwan. The war was planned as a massive NATO weapons cache found in Ukraine. NATO=Rome's military.  Are British special forces about to blow up evidence of NATO massive weapons cache in Ukraine?  NATO might attack the Solomon Islands if they militarize, but NATO militarized Ukraine as cache's prove.  All non NATO nations may war against NATO if they declare war, using their own doctrine.  US Governor Ron Desantis attacks a sovereign city, attacking the Bible's John 8:32. !(?)(",-0.9997,Negative,0.015082208832208831,Netural,-0.32963210344314575,Negative

"*WW2 like war being started to hide WW2 like genocide.  Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and now ​a corona virus pandemic.* Corona means crown, and a virus attacking the crown/government is some thing exposing government (2Corinthians4:4).  *Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 can only apply to one place on earth.  Research it well to learn who has been behind slaughters for centuries!*  1John5:19 is trying to stop Daniel12:4,2:44,45.  *Hitler was an unexcommunicated Catholic, who rounded up to go to concentration camps because of a supposed typhus epidemic, and they were gassed on the way by vehicle exhaust, or by zyklon B rodent extermination gas(h#$%@3n)cyanide. Just like Hitler started a World War to hide the genocide, so are they now.*  NATO militerizing Ukraine against Russia for a long time.  *NATO changed the capital of Ukraine from a Russian word to a new name.  The West overthrew the Russian backed government less than 10 years ago and has been killing those still loyal to Russia and calling them separatists or Russian sympathizers.* There were massive quantities of UK/US rockets and rocket launchers, which regular Catholic Ukrainians use to destroy Russian military vehicles.  *NATO calls Russia stupid for having all there tanks in a row, but they were coming in to defend, but the leader(an actor), Nazi sympathizer, is either ignorant or planned the attack.*  Does any one remember World War Two?  Same happening. *Trump said 2 years ago,""We'll soon be at war with Russia and China"". The virus disappeared, because they couldn't explain new vaccines for new variants with out testing.  To get a vaccine would be a miracle in short time, but 30 miracles in a row?  The virus wasn't able to lock you down and control you, so they are starting WW3.  Why did virus lockdown include only being able to talk to family?  To hide information.* The people of Mariopul left for Catholic Poland(the land of most WW2 exterminations of the Church of Rome's enemies). Once empty, you can see on videos that buildings are being blown up like there is carpet bombing happening, but there is no missile or rocket seen in the sky.  NATO invents the idea that Russia has supersonic missiles that go faster than you can see.  Why would Russia use such advanced weapons to destroy low value buildings?  The explosions were too big for mortar fire and in very close timing, like a controlled demolition.  *Meanwhile all the Catholics are safe in Poland, accept the civilians who stayed to use the NATO rocket launchers in surprise attack against an unsuspecting Russian column, there to protect Russian people. Military strategists say Russia was stupid and clumsy, how they just casually drove in.  That was because they weren't attacking until they were attacked by thousands of handheld missiles.  Russian media was blocked in NATO Countries(why?).  If you have the truth, there is no reason to run from information.  RT(Chinese CGTN also), was one of the Russian sources blocked.*  There was a world wide confiscation of Russian people's assets being confiscated. Russia had been asking for talks and security guarantees, but Joe said basically (@)U.  This is the same as during WW2. *You can not let the Church that rides the Roman Empire of Revelation Apocalypse 17,18, destroy Acts2:44(communism). *Most picked up for isolation, were dead with in 70 days.*  Revelation says, *leave the Revelation18:4 group if they don't want to receive her plagues.  (Hello, if you don't want to receive her plagues!)* 
​According to Revelation 18 this group wears *scarlet(Catholic Cardinals),* and *purple(Catholic Bishops).*  It refers to a city Kingdom *(Rome is the only city kingdom in the world), that rules over the Kings of the earth.*  Where are the Kings?  *The Roman Empire broke in 2 and from those 2 divisions came 10 Countries.  The Pope was the eleventh, but he got rid of 3, and from the 7 he is chosen, and there will be 10 again.*  5 Countries on each leg of the Roman Empire. *The (cross or X) is on the shields(British flag, same as Roman shield) symbolizes the ten Kingdoms(X in Latin=10), and their religious beliefs. According to official writings no one may buy or sell or say a greeting to any one who has left the cross.  The X or cross originates from the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet the tau, which means a mark, both literal and figurative.  In The Bible book of Ezekiel 9, God put a tau(mark) on the people, and it was not for salvation.  Revelation/Apocalypse **13:18** says you won't be able to buy or sell with out the tau(mark) of the beast(Empire).*  Knowingly accepting this falsehood gets you condemned. *Popes have always had a mitre(triple tiered crown) with 666 on it in Latin (Vicarivs Filli Dei).* Latin letters have a number associated with it. 1John5:19 attacking (Daniel12:4)  *Clear your browser history and cache, and YouTube search and viewing history!* Please pray for me and you!  *Study Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 deeply, as people are putting their life on the line for you!*  **There is an unclaimed open offer of 1000 000 dollars to any one who can prove that Rome(Pope) is not the man in the Temple that rides the Roman Empire of Revelation 17,18.  In fact, that is why it is called the ""Roman""Catholic Church.*  Idols on Ste. Peter's Basilica(Rome), show that Rome is a complete fraud (Acts15, Exodus20, Deuteronomy 5). *Governments mandate vaccines all over the world, which causes sabotage, boycotts, protests, walk outs and people quittng, so as to destroy businesses.*  Those trying to Daniel12:4 about 1John5:19. *The Pope and the British Royals were found guilty of genocide, by the International Criminal Court, pre corona. Donald J. Trump attacked the International Criminal Court by the US financial system.* Revelation/Apocalypse17,18, 1John5:19, 2Corinthians4:4 is waring against God and humanity. *Not NWO Daniel 12:4, but 1John**5:19** OWO. Same as the genocide and war of WW2, and plague of 1918.*  Think! *Copy and share this information!(video record, record in audio, text, or ?*  They are attacking because of information exposing them. **There are two realities playing out.**  *1.* A corona virus pandemic and a vaccine to stop its spread.  *2.* Corona means crown(government) and there is a virus(information exposing/attacking the crown/government) and there is a computer/device anti virus(vaccine)(which is supposed to protect from malicious computer code) and this anti virus deletes information from your view.(turn off antivirus software!) *Trade your digital vaccine pass for a paper one and they lose control!  Do it!  They will go in to a frenzy because of this information.*  UK just passing laws to lock people up indefinitely, with no trial, take your kids, force tests, and send to concentration camps. *UK has released tender for businesses to contract cadaver services for millions of human corpses.  Mass emergency poison purchase in Australia.  Hitler used rat poison.* Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 ruled the world for 1260 years , as Bible foretold. Rome was beheading for observing the real Sabbath(not ((Sun)day) ""lord's day"" lord's day is a clever imposter of the Sabbath.) *Catholic Austrian Royals ruled Germany and Catholic Austrian Adolf Hitler authorized most exterminations, which were in Catholic Poland, which is now completely militarizing.  Revelation/Apocalypse17,18 eats it's children.  *××Every one needs a 2.5 micron air quality monitor, so you can see when you are being GASSED!xx*(Revelation13:15,18:5,*6*.)  *G7 nations are removing corona restrictions, to regain it by war powers, or a new bird flu plan.* G(7) of Revelation. Who will do the will of God? (*Revelation 18:6*) *Think about sabotaging NATO assets for sake of the world.  They are using hand held rocket launchers, so do the same.  Quit British Pound and US dollar, use Bitcoin or other!*  I've been warning for over two years that Rome would start a war with Russia and China to hide genocide.  *Roman Catholic Joe Biden attacking Acts2:44,45, Daniel2:44,45*  Gog and Magog are in Turkey, not Russia.  *Rome hates (Acts2:44,45; 4:32-35).*  Ukraine sinking their own ships and blowing up their own bridges.  *NATO has M.O.B. on flag, and goal is war on Acts2:44.* Rome planned Ukraine war for 2017(Pompeo).  *The Pope is the man of sin in the(false)temple with 666, and exterminating for generations, yet the US although it has the largest military, is naked and prostrated gratifying her Papal master, while UK readies her turn.  The world was counting on you.  Most cowardly in all history Ukraine war was started from Poland?(Italian/US forces were there) Who will obey God's Revelation18:4-8?  *I am not Russian.*  Fact finding mission finds Russia not guilty of genocide. Multi Nation Joint forces operation in Ukraine is Rome(since 2014).  *Ukrainian Azov Battalion (Nazis) killing those with out blue arm bands. Rome is staging the entire Ukraine scenario, pretending Zelensky is Mark who is an extreme athlete, or hoping he will be confused for Kiev Mayor.  Mark donated much wealth and science to the world and Rome stole it. *This is a take over of Ukraine/war on Russia, by Rome.*  Imagine NATO Countries attacking your Country and blaming yours, so as to attack you!  *All Countries of the world formally ask NATO's almost 900 military bases to leave your Countries or confiscate it, for war crimes in Ukraine, Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq(ask Scott Ritter about Iraq!) etc etc etc!*  This is a global tyrannical occupation. Christian media falsely announced that Russia invaded Ukraine, to start the war and later falsely announced that China invaded Taiwan. The war was planned as a massive NATO weapons cache found in Ukraine. NATO=Rome's military.  Are British special forces about to blow up evidence of NATO massive weapons cache in Ukraine?  NATO might attack the Solomon Islands if they militarize, but NATO militarized Ukraine as cache's prove. !((?(",-0.9996,Negative,0.005744470622789206,Netural,-0.32963210344314575,Negative

"Is the comment section a joke/meme? Did I miss something? The praise is a joke, right? 

Y’all can’t tell me y’all actually enjoy listening to this very lyrically bland girl sing in the most annoying nasal voice ever heard? Am I alone? Y’all like this?

I hate bashing on music. If you like it, then more power to you. But this is probably the only song in the history of music I have heard that has infuriated me to the point of madness. The voice. The lyrics. The “oh oh oh” parts that induce boredom.

It sounds like a fake song, if ever one could exist. It sounds like it was made by a machine that “thinks” this is what we’d like, though I’m sure an actual machine could do better. I wish this song was in another language so I could simply not understand it.

It does not help that’s it’s paired with the strangest and most unexpected music video I’ve seen in a long time. 

The only way for me to cope with this is to imagine the entire comment section is in on a joke that I did not receive the memo for. My life would be better if I simply forgot this song existed. It fills me with rage and I’m astounded that no one else feels this way.",0.5309,Positive,0.07947845804988662,Netural,-0.680656373500824,Negative

"Dance monkey
Танцуй, обезьянка

They say, ""Oh my god, I see the way you shine
Они говорят: «О боже, я вижу, как ты сияешь!
Take your hands, my dear, and place them both in mine
Дорогая, возьми меня за руки.
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
Знаешь, я застыла на месте, проходя мимо тебя,
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
И теперь я умоляю тебя станцевать еще раз.

Ooh, I see you, see you, seen you every time
О, я вижу, вижу, видела тебя каждый раз,
And oh my I, I like your style
И, о боже, мне нравится твой стиль.
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
Ты, ты заставляешь, заставляешь, заставляешь меня плакать,
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time""
И теперь я умоляю тебя станцевать еще раз».

So they say,
Поэтому они говорят:
""Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh
«Станцуй для меня, станцуй для меня, станцуй для меня, о-о-о,
I’ve never seen anybody do the things you do before""
Я никогда не видела никого, кто может делать то же, что и ты!»
They say,
Они говорят:
""Move for me, move for me,
«Двигайся для меня, двигайся для меня,
Move for me, eh-eh-eh
Двигайся для меня, эй-эй-эй.
And when you’re done I’ll make you do it all again""
И когда ты закончишь, я заставлю тебя делать это снова!»

I said, ""Oh my god, I see you walking by
Я сказала: «О боже, я вижу, ты проходишь мимо.
Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes""
Возьми меня за руки, дорогая, и смотри мне в глаза».
Just like a monkey, I’ve been dancing my whole life
Словно обезьянка, я танцевала всю свою жизнь,
But you just beg to see me dance just one more time
Но ты сейчас умоляешь меня станцевать еще раз:

""Ooh, I see you, see you, seen you every time
«О, я вижу, вижу, видела тебя каждый раз,
And oh my I, I like your style
И, о боже, мне нравится твой стиль.
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
Ты, ты заставляешь, заставляешь, заставляешь меня плакать,
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time""
И теперь я умоляю тебя станцевать еще раз».

Поэтому они говорят:

"Thank you ""Dance monkey"" on so many levels! Reminds me of Rosanne and the episode where Rosie dresses up as a man and thought it would be cool to hang out out in the bar. Not realizing others saw her as a man when she starts retorting back on this guy who's talking so big about his dimunitive dates! When he threatens to kick her butt, you get to see true vulnerability! Go Rosie! 
But this vid, brings on the vulnerability of all of us: the elderly, children, women and men, LBGQT communities and the attempt to cover it up with whatever the ""normal"" is at the moment! 
And then thinking about this on the day before Jesus' resurrection, and think how overwhelmingly vulnerable he was but still full of that mercy and compassion and not feel the need to cover up his cries nor ask his Father why?

"※%%&$#%#Because the world becomes the Great Depression and maintains economy when I print a self currency and sprinkle it, such a trickery cannot continue. Therefore the Freemason causes war and resets it.

The Freemason rules the world, and this organization is writing a scenario to most war.

In Japan, it was blockaded the economy by encircling ABCD, and oil was embargoed. This means death for a modern nation. Electricity stops, and a production line stops and cannot prevent the aggression of other countries when a weapon equipped with an engine is not usable. Therefore I make the first move for self-defense, and Pearl Harbor is to have attacked it. The United States won against war and I made demonstration of the power of the atom bomb in the Soviet Union and did a hero side and controlled the world after the war. And I got colony, Japan of the best money tree. The United States hit the commission of the slave who made money in an article made in Japan produced in high technology and was able to become the King who could enjoy luxury. The Okinawa return of the United States still controls Japan effectively with the thing only for forms and will have the colony. The reason why the eirei that scuttled itself fought till the last is that I prevent the colonial rule. I believed that Japan revived as far as the Japanese spirit continued and closed my eyes forever.

The founding of a country of the United States slaughters the native candy reperception and begins by having plundered the territory. Europe and America of the principle of cruel supremacy of white invaded Asia and had the colony. Roosevelt, Churchill with a sense of crisis, the Stalin and others stopped at Japan which won against Russo-Japanese War against it gaining power and gathered and provoked Japan and drained PROBAGANDA which trained Japan to be an invader and were going to let Japan ruin. A wirepuller of Chiang Kai-shek was these free Mason and let you carry out an anti-Japan activity and repeated Japanese slaughter of Tyushu case The retaliation becomes the Shanghai incidents. Japan built the Manchurian country and was going to build the utopia by the rule of virtue. Japan makes a Mongoloid Korean of the same kind a sex slave and cannot slaughter the Chinese very much in Nanjing. I will pass not only Europe and America but also Asia to the enemy if I do something like that and Japan stands alone and ruins myself. I cannot perform such a suicidal act.

The United States was approximately 10 times in Japan when they compared the strength of a nation of the United States with Japan at the time of the Greater East Asia War (the strength of a nation of the United States comes from a colony and profit of the black ivory). In other words, it is the quarrel of a child and adult. Why does it invade it? Even if Japan was found to lose, I believed that it was a fight of the justice and fought. When it did Pearl Harbor attack, only sank a superannuation warship; misfired. You set the second attack, and why did you not blow up an airport base, a naval shipyard, an oil tank? You occupied Hawaii, and did you not do an aircraft carrier confrontation? In brief, this Pearl Harbor attack angered the American nation, and the fighting spirit was a stratagem to let you become exalted. Emperor Showa, cabinet minister, all the navy government bodies were Mason.

American Mason performs a plot a lot. There is the self-writing, self-Playing false flag strategy. There are the fight of the Alamo fort, a main issue case, Mayflower case, Gulf of Tonkin case, Pearl Harbor attack (I order a Japanese agent), 9,11 terrorist incident, Paris terrorist incident, J F Kennedy assassination case, Diana assassination case, a plane shooting down case (I order Ukraine) in Malaysia.

The equality was the concept that Mason thought about, and a phase contradicted freedom each other. If a company raises profit freely, there is it, and a rich person and poorman do not become equal. Freedom is restricted if I have the frames saying that I do it equally. Freedom and the equality are Operation double eagle of Mason. Of the quarrel that is fixed all the same not antagonism with the thing which Mason produced in both the liberalism nation and the communist state only play it. As for being hidden in the depths as for the commander-in-chief (Israel) of the evil in Revelation of Sun and Moon GOD. The world is instructed with structure braking under the pretense of two generals (Russia) quarrelling with one general (the United States) very much. In other words, Russia is together with the United States and rigs. Roosevelt ordered three Soviet Union from Stalin by a secret agreement of Yalta. The United States let money pay to Japan and, at the time of the Soviet Union collapse, saved the Soviet Union. Where is antagonism?

The Democratic Party copulates, too, and the LDP only rigs in the same way, too. Therefore I am under the patronage of Mason even if whichever wins. The American Republican and Democratic parties is the same, too. In other words, cards are marionettes of Mason. North Korea and the United States only perform a fixed quarrel when I understand this thing, and it is revealed that the United States lets you shoot a missile for Japan.

Cards and Putin advocate anti-Judea, but it is a downright lie. The Nazis advocated anti-Judea, too, but Germany of the defeated nation of World War I was made to assume a burden of the indemnification payment, and why did you manage to raise those war expenditures? I received support of the Judah iron. The Nazis had techniques such as a rocket, atom bomb development, the UFO production. Nazi cannot lose. In other words, I lost on purpose.

I let you accept the Plaza Accord and guide it to the strong yen that the United States makes Japan a bubble burst as for the Japan Airlines airplane 123 flights accident and snatches Japanese financial power of a nation by financial products (dice game gambling to say that the stock prices of Japan fall) and a share price manipulation and a fraud to say and am a threat case to lead it to the stock prices sudden fall. Salomon Brothers which sold a stock at a profit before a sudden fall obtained a vast profit. A pilot at U.S. forces shot it down and burnt the person whom a Korean military unit survived to death by a flame thrower. I shot a member of Self-Defense Forces with the sense of justice that was going to help it dead. As for the conduct like this devil being possible, there is only Mason. Therefore Boeing accepted the repair error of the false charge. Boeing refuses the act of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces decidedly.

Near future to read from Revelation Sun and Moon GOD and illuminaty card, and to untie it in Japan

April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, Korea, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3 (Armageddon of the nuclear war). It is the last war with original God and the evil god. Japan is the country which original God protects in a land of the gods, and the evil god (Freemason) holds the Japanese people hostage and is made to have an experience cruel most because it is the stomach which is going to conquer original God.

x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021 (the black ship second coming).
World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day (Armageddon of the nuclear war).
Mount Fuji is a great eruption on xx day in October, 2023. The natural disasters such as major earthquakes occur in a row in all parts of the world.
An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023. The earth becomes muddy sea.
The world (Buddhists' paradise) of the Maitreya is realized on xx moon xx day in 2024.

Final note
The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other I kill a cow pig, and to eat meat? I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. The human being takes the life of the lovely animal unconcernedly. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. A fornication is an act of the beast profaning God. A thing of the world is a thing of God, and the devil is the thief who stole the world from God and is a fraud deceiving the people. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. It is the devil that it behaves like God in original God that the devil can see in the present world. Therefore a disaster, an epidemic, the war damage giving an evil to the people are the wrath of Heaven. Why was much human life robbed of it by the Great East Japan Earthquake? As for it, a human evil deed was judged Ogami. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. I lead the world to the World War 3 that Freemason finally acts as order of the evil. I let a vindictive spirit does satanophany in the Freemason, and war cause. The World War 3 is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light. Are all of you ready????>>>?.....",-0.9996,Negative,-0.049317398794142986,Negative,-0.49459150433540344,Negative
