"I'm so into you
I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do
Is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough
'Til we cross the line, yeah, yeah
So name a game to play
And I'll role the dice, hey
Oh, baby, look what you started

Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you
To make a move
(Woo, ooh, ooh)
Before I make a move
(Woo, ooh, ooh)
So baby, come light me up
And maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous,
But baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and
A little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you
Into you
Into you
Got everyone watchin' us
So baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous
But baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and
A little more touch my body

Into you
Into you
Oh, yeah
This could take some time, hey
I made too many mistakes
Better get this right, right, baby

I love my Machiah who separated from me to ha die screaming babies for the mother dealing with doa..and the bloodline end..and we’ve rested ever since.

Well that’s the thinking of all old dogs we are just on new streets..the whole time I was thinking “I better restore world order with hermaphidite or my ass is grass” because if the father gets up he’s not taking the time to fight nothing to fix it oh restart every bodies dead and so the women like Archer Spaniard and Nepolwon Bonapart do things to restore order and fix things so the ken won’t get up that’s why you should prefer the women and not say Archer Spaniard you ain’t no man out here ..that’s how it goes.. women fight to fix or the men will destroy without questions “everyone” so I guess little least posed I do have a heart and I would use it to kill you easily to restore world order..so yep.

This is how you have to think with Ava why does a good distributor have a commercial that never happens and why are they calling to protest it? Processed foods? What protest is this? Oh what it really is is the food distributor won’t but my tech inside their groceries they ship to major supermarkets for everyday people to become my victims easily..that’s why it’s hard to see her but you’ve got to think that way with her. And I did to stop everything..and that was just one project out of countless ..that’s why I work that way handle and then move  to the next. Doa is all about reverberations on her real plan to stay for we get the real people for real outside of virtual she just never does anything herself. So has access to the real people big faces and that’s how she works unnoticed. If I have the love if the real people or the kind of the real people or even the real people I can stay forever.

Oh this tine it was Ava on the main stage not hitler still doing the same and I made sure she couldn’t but it’s rough up there she learned..and so all went well but I wouldn’t advise that the government examine her further she’s dangerous by the time you recognize what she is doing she’s in process of protesting the entity that won’t cooperate asking you to protest..and into every single project on the planet doing it administratively being smart not doing much in the body but doing it the right way..and that’s why if someone is always in court and always petitioning the government in court literally for real world domination it’s hard to catch them..and that’s why. But that was a trust obligation of mine as Archer Spaniard and so that’s who I’m busy with what I will say as she evolved the advanced system where one idea isn’t enough so that’s what she was chasing money and the main goal to find off the grid capital cities light them up and sell them off to make endless money.

So yep he showed up as himself this time not his 1940s invention where he led a war against the world the hunchback of notra dame..and that was it.

Before I make a move

A little more touch my body

A little more touch my body

Into you

"There is a variety of opinions about what constitutes a Jezebel spirit, everything from sexual looseness in a woman to the teaching of false doctrine—by a man or a woman. The Bible does not mention a Jezebel spirit, although it has plenty to say about Jezebel herself.

Jezebel’s story is found in 1 and 2 Kings. She was the daughter of Ethbaal, king of Tyre/Sidon and priest of the cult of Baal, a cruel, sensuous and revolting false god whose worship involved sexual degradation and lewdness. Ahab, king of Israel, married Jezebel and led the nation into Baal worship (1 Kings 16:31). Ahab and Jezebel’s reign over Israel is one of the saddest chapters in the history of God’s people.

There are two incidents in the life of Jezebel that characterize her and may define what is meant by the “Jezebel spirit.” One trait is her obsessive passion for domineering and controlling others, especially in the spiritual realm. When she became queen, she began a relentless campaign to rid Israel of all evidences of Yahweh worship. She ordered the extermination of all the prophets of the Lord (1 Kings 18:4, 13) and replaced their altars with those of Baal. Her strongest enemy was Elijah, who demanded a contest on Mount Carmel between the powers of Israel’s God and the powers of Jezebel and the priests of Baal (1 Kings 18). Of course, God won, but despite hearing of the miraculous powers of the Lord, Jezebel refused to repent and swore on her gods that she would pursue Elijah relentlessly and take his life. Her stubborn refusal to see and submit to the power of the living God would lead her to a hideous end (2 Kings 9:29–37).

The second incident involves a righteous man named Naboth who refused to sell to Ahab land adjoining the palace, rightly declaring that to sell his inheritance would be against the Lord’s command (1 Kings 21:3; Leviticus 25:23). While Ahab sulked and fumed on his bed, Jezebel taunted and ridiculed him for his weakness, then proceeded to have the innocent Naboth framed and stoned to death. Naboth’s sons were also stoned to death, so there would be no heirs, and the land would revert to the possession of the king. Such a single-minded determination to have one’s way, no matter who is destroyed in the process, is a characteristic of the Jezebel spirit.

So infamous was Jezebel’s sexual immorality and idol worship that the Lord Jesus Himself refers to her in a warning to the church at Thyatira (Revelation 2:18-29). Most likely referring to a woman in the church who influenced it the same way Jezebel influenced Israel into idolatry and sexual immorality, Jesus declares to the Thyatirans that she is not to be tolerated. Whoever this woman was, like Jezebel, she refused to repent of her immorality and her false teaching, and her fate was sealed. The Lord Jesus cast her onto a sick bed, along with those who committed idolatry with her. The end for those who succumb to a Jezebel spirit is always death and destruction, both in the physical and the spiritual sense.

Perhaps the best way to define the Jezebel spirit is to say it characterizes anyone who acts in the same manner as Jezebel did, engaging in immorality, idolatry, false teaching, and unrepentant sin. To go beyond that is to engage in conjecture and can possibly lead to false accusations and divisiveness within the body of Christ.",-0.9858,Negative,0.0225779967159277,Positive,0.2712934613227844,Neutral
"What does 1 Corinthians 6:9 mean? [⇑ See verse text ⇑]
Between here and verse 11, Paul makes it clear that how one lives reflects their relationship with Christ. At the same time, the gospel offers forgiveness and salvation to absolutely anyone willing to come to God in faith. Paul also makes a reference to sexual sins which modern interpreters sometimes attempt to ignore.

The idea of inheriting the kingdom of God or inheriting eternal life came out of the Jewish culture of the day. Jesus talked about it quite a bit (Luke 10:25; 18:18). The inheritance of a kingdom is not earned; it is passed on to the children of the king. Those who inherit God's kingdom are also receiving eternal life with Him in His glory forever.

Paul asks another ""do you not know"" question to remind the Corinthian Christians. This one reminds them of one group who will not inherit God's kingdom: the unrighteous—or the wicked, the wrongdoers. In Romans, Paul's clear teaching of the gospel is this: Only those who come to God through faith in Jesus are declared by God to be righteous (Romans 3:21–26). Only they will inherit God's kingdom.

Paul provides examples of those who are unrighteous, identifying them by the sins they embrace. Most of these practices would have been common in the Greek and Roman culture of the day. They include sexual immorality, meaning every kind of sex outside of heterosexual marriage, idol worship, adultery, meaning sex with another's spouse, and homosexual acts.

The words translated as ""practice homosexuality"" in the ESV include two Greek words: malakoi and arsenokoitai. Respectively, these indicate the passive and active participants in same-sex sexual behaviors. Translations such as the KJV, NASB, and NLT translate these as entirely separate expressions of sexual sin. Some recent re-interpretations claim these words refer only to homosexual prostitution or homosexual sex with children. Such a claim does not fit with consistent translation practices, the context of this passage, the universal interpretation of the passage for thousands of years, or with Paul's other teaching on the subject, such as Romans 1:26–27. In short, this is one of the New Testament's clear indications that homosexual actions—not temptations themselves, but behaviors—are deeply and unmistakably sinful. Embracing such behavior shows a deep rejection of God, just as much as would idolatry or cheating in business.

Paul will expand this list of Christ-denying actions in the following verse.

In verse 11, however, Paul will explain that those identifying labels are removed when a person comes to faith in Christ and is declared righteous by God. A person forgiven in Christ defines those sins as ""past tense."" They do not define who they are, or will be. Paul has made it clear that his target audience are born-again believers (1 Corinthians 1:2, 9). Some of them used to be known by these labels because of their sin. But that is not who they are any longer. Now, they are in Christ. As such, they must stop participating in any of these sins.
Context Summary
First Corinthians 6:1–11 details Paul's objections to Christians taking another to secular court over a minor issue. Believers will one day judge the world and angels. They should be able to judge small disputes amongst themselves. It would be better for a believer to be defrauded than to ask unbelievers to settle an argument between brothers in Christ. After all, unbelievers will not inherit God's kingdom. They are known by all the sins they do. Christians, though, have been cleansed from those sins and are now known only as belonging to Christ. This passage includes a passionate, powerful reminder that no person's sins are beyond Christ's power to forgive.


Chapter Summary
First Corinthians 6 continues Paul's confrontations of the Corinthian Christians over issues in the church. Earlier passages discussed problems of division into factions, and tolerance of heinous sexual sin. Paul is also outraged that they would take one another to court in a lawsuit over minor issues. Instead of suing each other before unbelievers, they should settle trivial issues in the church. Second, Paul urges them to live up to their new identities in Christ instead of living down to the sexually immoral standards of the culture. This sets up discussions of marriage in chapter 7.",-0.9848,Negative,0.0693492618492618,Positive,0.2527406513690948,Neutral
