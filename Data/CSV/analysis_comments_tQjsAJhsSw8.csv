"Lighting stog after stog, choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
Help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup, blunt after blunt
I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck, ha, ha, ha
In the cut and I put that on my momma
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either the pussy or the commas
Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sending all her friends snaps of my new tracks
'Cause all these hoes know what's about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands I just wanna go
Man I just wanna go flex

"lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Lighting stog after stog, I choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
They help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup
Blunt after blunt, I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck
Ha, ha, ha, uh, in the cut and I put that on my mama
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either pussy or the commas

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Verse 2]
Uh, yeah, push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but she says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sendin' all her friends snaps of my new tracks
'Cause all these hoes know what's about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands, I just wanna go

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Bridge]
Knowing all of this, it just don't make a difference
I'm just talking shit to the ones that'll listen
I come with the heat, man, I swear I'm never missing
And I'm still the same and I swear I'm never switching
Knowing all of this, it just don't make a difference
I'm just talking shit to the ones that'll listen
I come with the heat, man, I swear I'm never missing
And I'm still the same and I swear I'm never switching

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

"Jesus Christ Saves

Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.

Jesus Christ died on the cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later to pay for the sins of mankind to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.

EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:

1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.
2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.

"Lighting stog after stog, choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
Help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup, blunt after blunt
I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck, ha, ha, ha
In the cut and I put that on my momma
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either the pussy or the commas
Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sending all her friends snaps of my new tracks
'Cause all these hoes know what's about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands I just wanna go

"Jesus Christ Saves

Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.

Jesus Christ died on the cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later to pay for the sins of mankind to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.

EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:

1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.
2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.

She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sending all her friends snaps of my new tracks

"Lighting stog after stog, choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
Help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup, blunt after blunt
I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck, ha, ha, ha
In the cut and I put that on my momma
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either the pussy or the commas

Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

Push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sending all her friends snaps of my new tracks
'Cause all these hoes know what's about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands I just wanna go

Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
