"Я не фанат соцсетей и писал по эл. почте коллегам, это текст:

Уважаемые друзья, соотечественники, коллеги!

К вам обращается ваш бывший коллега - Роман Павлюченко. Я работал ... в Минске в .. г.г. Как украинцы, вы сразу понимаете, что Павлюченко - это чисто украинская фамилия. До сегодняшних событий я никогда не воспринимал себя как украинец или белорус (мои родители по материнской линии - белорусы, а по отцовской - украинцы). Я всегда думал, что я советский русский человек, но теперь уже нет... Может и в чем-то советский, будучи рожденным и воспитанным в СССР, но уже не русский... Я перестал быть русским после бомбежек Мариуполя 1000 кг бомбами. Я перестал быть русским после мертвых детей. Я перестал быть русским после Харькова. Я уже не плачу, потому что у меня нет слез. Разве они есть у харьковчан? Или они есть у моих киевских родственников и друзей? Нет, все слезы давно выплаканы. Осталось только сражаться и умереть, как подобает человеку.

Мне, как и сотням тысячам белорусам, безумно стыдно, что Беларусь предательски вонзила нож вам в самый страшный час. Я всегда верил в братство трех народов, которое я олицетворял своим белорусско-украинским происхождением и родным русским языком и культурой, которые вскормили меня как человека и личность. Простите нас, любимые украинцы, за ракеты, летящие с нашей территории. Простите за войска оккупантов, проходящих через нас. За все простите. Но нам нет прощения и никогда больше мы его не вымолим. Те, кто говорит или думает, что он ни при чем - глубоко ошибается. Немцы в 1939 году тоже думали, что они ни при чем. А потом бомбили Дрезднен и горел даже бетон.

Я работал 11 лет с Оксаной ..., Славой ... и многими другими. Боже, я такой старый, что помню ... и Наташу ... И после всех наших командировок, после того, как вы нас принимали...а вы нас так любили! Нас никто так не принимал, как украинцы. Вы нас обнимали, называли друзьями, братьями, а мы...

Когда вы победите, мы попросим у вас на коленях прощения, но это потом. А сейчас я хочу сказать вам, что я горжусь своей украинской кровью, горжусь своим Президентом Зеленским, горжусь вашими и своими политиками такими, как Арестович, Подоляк, Бутусов, Геращенко и многими другими. У нас таких нет вообще, просто ни одного. Вы показали всему миру, как надо относится к своей нации, к флагу. Вы доказали кровью, что вы - нация. Мы этого сделать не смогли 2 года назад, а тогда был шанс... Украина - это не Россия, как говорил и писал классик. К сожалению, и не Беларусь. И поэтому Искандеры и Калибры летят к вам от нас. Они - это плата за наше малодушие. Ревущие самолеты на наших аэродромах летят убивать вас, и мы все это знаем. Мы не сделали свой выбор тогда, и теперь вы платите своей кровью. Мы скоты, мы хуже скотов, потому что мы предали вас, наших самых близких и любимых людей. Простите нас когда-нибудь, если сможете, если это вообще возможно.

Роман Павлюченко, украинец, белорус, ваш коллега",0.8817,Positive,0.1400689223057644,Neutral,0.285125195980072,Neutral

"Má ruka šmátralka, v rámci staré moudrosti v zrcadle současnosti, zalovila v mé ošatce humoru a melodií a šup, můj textík z 22.5.2019. Se vší skromností cituji ze své, v této podobě nikdy nevydané knihy, Peril of the Soul. Pro dokonalé „nacítění“ doporučuji Queen - Radio Ga Ga (Live Aid 1985). Bratra Mercuria mám rád, známe se z druhé strany. Pac a pusu, Gugu. 


Podstatnou otázkou je, co to vlastně je demokracie a co by to být mělo?  
Když se rozhlédneme, je tu tolik demokracie, že je to až k neuvěření. Demokraté jsou všude, kam se podívám. Přímí demokraté pod přímým vedením Tomia Okamury, který jako příkladně demokratickou chápe KSČM  vedenou komunistickými fízli, bachaři a jejich potomky, bývalými pohraničníky, vojáky a členy STB, stalinisty a mocichtivými kreaturami prakticky bez jakékoliv ideové identity. A pak tu máme ANO, taktéž příkladně demokratické hnutí, pod přímým, demokratickým  vedením altruistického velkopodnikatele, který přímo, jasně a srozumitelně deklamuje svoji demokratickou neodvolatelnost a ještě demokratičtější touhu zprivatizovat celý stát. Pokud si z tohoto letmého nástinu analýzy reálných projevů demokracie uděláme nějaký závěr, potom demokracie znamená vládu  nejagresivnějších jedinců schopných pomocí lží, slibů, podplácením a  prezentací své síly manipulovat  ostatními lidmi. Ostatně kolébkou demokracie jsou antické, řecké městské státy a tedy vojenská společnost ve které byla rovnost menšiny vykoupena naprostým zotročením většiny. Nejsem si ovšem jistý, jestli je tohle opravdu to, co voliči těchto demokratických stran chtějí a co se jaksi nereflektovaně tímto reálně stále prázdnějším termínem  míní.

"I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know, or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

You've yet to have your finest hour

How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things, on you we depend
So stick around, 'cause we might miss you

"I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know, or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things, on you we depend
So stick around, 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

I was a child about 12 when I beg my mother to pay for this on premium HBO.  She look at me kinda strange but got it anyway.(thinking bcus I'm African decense and why would a child be interested in white folks music.) So when it got to Queen my mother relieved that she also was a fan of Queen. She didn't realize that they sang Another one bite the dust. And while they sang Radio Ga Gaa I remember look back at her parting her foot to it. I knew I was looking at legendary show but I didn't know that day I help my mother change her point of view on life. She told me this many years later.

"I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio

Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys

"Jesus Christ Saves

Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.

Jesus Christ died on the cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later to pay for the sins of mankind to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.

EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:

1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.
2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.

Biblical References:
1. Romans 5:9
2. Romans 3:23
3. Romans 6:23
4. Romans 10:9
5. Romans 10:13
6. Ephesians 2: 8 & 9
7. John 3:16
