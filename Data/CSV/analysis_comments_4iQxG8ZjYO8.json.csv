"Fun fact: The meaning behind this song stems from when she was a street performer in Australia. You are required to have a permit in order to do so, and a lot of the ""customers"" were known for being super rude and treating her like she was some zoo animal who was meant for their amusement. 

She said that they made her feel as though they were saying ""Sing, monkey"". However, in order to make the song slightly less personal, she changed it to ""Dance Monkey"", rather than ""Sing Monkey"", which is what she was actually doing.",0.8481,Positive,-0.03833333333333334,Negative,0.5613678693771362,Positive
