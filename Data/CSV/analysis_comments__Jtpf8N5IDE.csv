"Beautiful song. And very insightful, At first, one would answer the question it poses with an unequivocal ""yes."" The concept of eternal life is common o the Three Great Monotheistic Faiths, But think about it-- The first few hundred years would be great. You would have travelled everywhere, gotten many advanced degrees if you were so inclined, met thousands of interesting people, made love to thousands more. You would have indulged your senses in every way imaginable. After a thousand years you would have met everyone you'd have wanted to meet, gone everywhere you wanted to go. The mere presence of your loved ones whom you once held so dear would now be a major irritant. you'd have done pretty much everything you'd have wanted to do, so what's left? You could do them again, but they would have lost much of their appeal after you've done them already, let alone thousands of times. This is eternity after all. You'd be bored shitless. Life is precious because it limited. If it were to last forever it would eventually lose all of it's meaning.                                      .",0.9828,Positive,0.2454613095238095,Neutral,0.4517442882061004,Positive

Who wants to live forever

There's no chance for us
It's all decided for us
This world has only one sweet moment set aside for us

Who wants to live forever
Who wants to live forever
Ooh
Who dares to love forever
Oh oo woh, when love must die

But touch my tears with your lips
Touch my world with your fingertips

There's no place for us
What is the thing
That builds our dreams
Yet slips away from us?
Who wants to live forever
Who wants to live forever?
There's no chance for us
It's all decided for us
This world has only
One sweet moment
Set aside for us
Who wants to live forever
Who wants to live forever?
Who dares to love forever
When love must die?
But touch my tears
With your lips
Touch my world
With your fingertips
And we can have forever

When I was a kid I fell in love with Queen. I asked my mom to get me all the CD's they made and loved listening to them. Yet still to this day when ever I hear any of their songs I'm still loving it like I did oh so many years ago. I just wish some radio stations would play MORE of their music and a bit more of a selection as they had many great songs that are almost forgotten to some radio stations. This being one of those songs. I don't care if I can't sing it 1/10th as well as Freddie did cause I'm STILL going to sing along with it.,0.9704,Positive,0.575,Positive,0.464851975440979,Positive

"This song is so beautiful. But I kept avoiding to listen to it because it just made me so sad and it didn’t sit well with my depression. But these past days I’ve been listening to it along with other Queen songs. And today for the first time ever it crossed my mind that when the song started, that wasn’t Freddie’s voice. I was like, wait, that’s not Freddie, it has to be Brian singing. And I search for the video and sure enough it was Brian. The exact same thing happened when I listened to I Want It All for the first time, I just knew Brian was singing too. And it blew my mind because I used to listen to Queen when I was really small and that was more than 20 years ago, so I didn’t really know how their voices sounded like, except for Freddie. And then I listen to these songs and I can recognize Brian’s voice right away. He’s got a beautiful voice too.",0.7398,Positive,0.1873809523809524,Neutral,0.352145105600357,Positive

Здесь нет мест для нас...
И все мечты здесь не о нас,
Всё это не про нас.

Но нам не жить здесь вечно,
Ведь жизнь не безконечна… ?

Есть лишь шанс для нас,
Бог решает за нас…
Есть в  нашем мире сладкий миг,
Оставленный для нас.

Но нам не жить здесь вечно,
Ведь жизнь не безконечна… ?

Где здесь любовь навечно?
Всем смерть воздаст.

Прикоснись до ресниц,
Взяв мой мир взмахом крыльев птиц

И вечность станет нашей,
Любовь вдруг станет вечной…
Конечно…но лишь на день..

Но нам не жить здесь вечно,

"I saw Queen twice in my late teens, right after the release of News of the World. It was pretty much decided that we were witnessing one of the greatest bands in the history of Rock music and music in general. Considering the emphasis on slick guitar solos during that time and Brian May being principally (by his own admission) a rhythm guitarist, it was amazing how much sophisticated sound they generated from three instruments and Freddie occasionally playing piano on some songs. In addition to Freddie's otherwordly vocals they were phenomenal songwriters as well. They remain the tightest band I ever saw on the stage. For me, and maybe others who believe in the same way, Who Wants to Live Forever is their finest song. It has become the song I think of when Queen comes to mind, even over Bohemian Rhapsody. We'll never see this quality of talent assembled in one band ever again. Simply amazing.",0.975,Positive,0.2807104660045837,Neutral,0.8556108474731445,Positive

"Omg, I was listening to this and I opened my English book to do my homework, and guess what was the first exercise? 
UNDERLINE THE CORRECT OPTION 

1) Freddie might \ might not come to the concert. He's sick. 
Of course, I underlined 'might', even if maybe it's not grammatically correct... 
🥺

By the way, I adore Queen, and this song... really shows how brave a man Freddie was. Instead of closing up and moaning, he went out, fighting against AIDS and singing beautiful songs. Love you, Freddie, you legend ❤️And of course, beautiful song, Brian, and Good job everyone!
