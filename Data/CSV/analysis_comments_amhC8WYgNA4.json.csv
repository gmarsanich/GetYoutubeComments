"Music isn’t about color or genre it is about art! This was a great “crossover” and Lil Nas X & Billy Ray crushed this. It shouldn’t matter that one is black or white. In my wealthy neighborhood Americans of color are accepted to any party, cookout or event and treated with class and respect. In my experience I’ve been invited to places in South Carolina and LA that men of my color should never go and not once had a problem. I even ended up giving golf lessons. Treat people with class and respect and you will get the same in return. This song is great and I love it.",0.9774,Positive,0.2916666666666667,Netural,0.9180600047111511,Positive
