Ariana Grande video locations feature some cool fornications. I am talking about the vaulted ceilings and those arches. Every video has this style of classical luxury. I wonder why? Is she studying architecture? Also loads of columns and round windows.. I have watched four in a row now and paused several times for the cool backgrounds in the clips. The only one that didn´t have it was the Charlie´s angels one. (no tears and break up with your girlfriend are the other ones I watched) It doesn´t seem to be all videos.,0.4696,Positive,0.0535714285714285,Positive,0.3984327614307403,Positive

I want to know. I want to throw the person in jail. Good luck having kids in this society, let alone women getting respect. I dont even know why people like arianna grande try with the terrorism that now exist.

"The elements of the gospel are clearly stated in 1 Corinthians 15:3–6, a key passage concerning the good news of God: “For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve. After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living.” Notice, first, that Paul “received” the gospel and then “passed it on”; this is a divine message, not a man-made invention. Second, the gospel is “of first importance.” Everywhere the apostles went, they preached the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ. Third, the message of the gospel is accompanied by proofs: Christ died for our sins (proved by His burial), and He rose again the third day (proved by the eyewitnesses). Fourth, all this was done “according to the Scriptures”; the theme of the whole Bible is the salvation of mankind through Christ. The Bible is the gospel.",-0.1027,Negative,0.209375,Positive,0.2749818861484527,Neutral

"Romans 10:9-10- If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. 

Accept Jesus into your life today He is loving and everything you need in this life and the life after! He loves you immensely, open up Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John in your Bible and read about Him. Get to know who He is :). John 14:6- Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.""✝️❤ Being a Christian will not always be easy, and does not mean that you won't experience temptation and sin; we are humans after all. Furthermore, we must ask for forgiveness for all of our sins. You may lay your burdens at His feet. Forgiving others for their sins is also very important. 

Jesus said- ""14For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 15But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins."" (Matthew 6:14-15) 

""8If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. 9If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. 10If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us."" (1 John 1:8-10) 

“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."" (Matthew 11:28).
We are cleansed by the blood of Jesus because of His great sacrifice on the cross. 

"" 16For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son."" (John 3:16-18) 

""6If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth. 7But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin."" (1 John 1:6-7) 

If you seek God, you are seeking eternity with Him!

"Ariana really went and worked on her diction. I am so happy for her. We can understand every single thing she sings, and she’s probably the best singer we’ve gotten from her generation, easily. Not probably. She can sing along with Mariah, JHUD, whoever. She is an amazing singer, and this is my song for her. I think it’s awesome she got the music and felt it was so innocent and Disney like, and she decided to make it dirty. Easily my favorite song by her, and I’m happy she was humble enough to know she needed to work on herself, and she wasn’t perfect. I love her to death. I feel like she’s more down to earth than we know. She can be a bitch, but so can all of us. I love 7 Rings too. I just thought this was her era, and I have no respect for the Grammys after they snubbed her for that album. Even Billie Eilish said she felt like she was receiving Ariana Grande’s award at the Scammies. That’s cuz she was. I don’t know why they waited till Billie Eilish turned 18 before they gave her an award. I thought that was the only reason she got it. She should’ve gotten it way earlier. Don’t get me wrong, I think she’s an amazing artist, but Ariana ruled that year, and she should’ve gone home with five trophies, easily. I will never watch that dumbass show again. Plus it’s boring as hell for the past 20 years.I want to gouge my eyes out and turn off my ears with my bare hands. I’m so done. I’m just bored with all this slow songs. Forget that “award show”.

"You might think I'm crazy
The way I've been craving
If I put it quite plainly
Just gimme them babies
So what you doing tonight?
Better say, ""Doing you right"" (Yeah)
Watching movies, but we ain't seen a thing tonight (Yeah)

I don't wanna keep you up (You up)
But show me, can you keep it up? (It up)
'Cause then I'll have to keep you up
Shit, maybe I'ma keep you up, boy
I've been drinking coffee (I've been drinking coffee; coffee)
And I've been eating healthy (I've been eating healthy; healthy)
You know I keep it squeaky, yeah (You know I keep it squeaky)
Saving up my energy (Yeah, yeah, saving up my energy)

Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight
Thirty-four, thirty-five (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can you stay up all night? (All night)
Fuck me 'til the daylight
Thirty-four, thirty-five (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Doja Cat (Ariana Grande):]
Can we stay up all night? Fuck a jet lag
You bring your fine ass and overnight bag
Add up the numbers or get behind that
Play and rewind that, listen, you'll find that
I want that six-nine without Tekashi
And I want your body and I make it obvious
Wake up the neighbors, we got an audience
They hear the clapping, but we not applauding 'em
Six o'clock and I'm crushing
Then it get to seven o'clock now he wants it
When it hit eight o'clock, we said, ""Fuck it""
Forget your girl, pretend that I'm her
Come make the cat purr, come make my back hurt, ayy
Making that squirt and rain and shower and spray
Now that's perfect, baby, we don't sleep enough
But I'ma keep you up, if you could keep it up (Baby)

[Ariana Grande:]
Can you stay up all night? (All night)
Fuck me 'til the daylight (Daylight)
Thirty-four, thirty-five (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can you stay up all night? (Can you stay?)
Fuck me 'til the daylight (Can you stay?)
Thirty-four, thirty-five (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Megan Thee Stallion:]
Rock you like a baby, but you know I'm 'bout to keep you up
Welcome to my channel, and today I'm 'bout to teach you something
I can make you pop, legs up like a Cancan
Wake the neighbors up, make it sound like the band playing
Bitch, let me get cute (Yeah)
He's about to come through (He's about to come through)
I've been in the shower for 'bout a whole hour
He finna act a dog in it so he get the bald kitty
Netflix or Hulu? Baby, you choose
I'm up like Starbucks, three pumps, ooh
This pussy good for ya health, call it superfood
When I'm by myself, DIY like it's YouTube
Bad, bad bitch, all the boys wanna spank me (Spank me)
Left him on read, girlfriend need to thank me (Thank me)
Make his toes point, ballerina, no tutu
Baby, I'm the best, I don't know what the rest do (Ayy, ayy, ayy, yeah)
Dive in that water like a private island
Thirty-four, thirty-five, we can sixty-nine it
And I been a bad girl but this pussy on the good list (Good list)
I hope you ain't tired, we ain't stopping 'til I finish (Ayy, ayy, ayy, yeah)

[Ariana Grande:]
Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight (Yeah, yeah)
Thirty-four, thirty-five (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Thirty-four, thirty-five)
Can you stay up all night? (Do you know what that means?)
Fuck me 'til the daylight (Do you know what that means?)
Thirty-four, thirty-five (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

"There is a variety of opinions about what constitutes a Jezebel spirit, everything from sexual looseness in a woman to the teaching of false doctrine—by a man or a woman. The Bible does not mention a Jezebel spirit, although it has plenty to say about Jezebel herself.

Jezebel’s story is found in 1 and 2 Kings. She was the daughter of Ethbaal, king of Tyre/Sidon and priest of the cult of Baal, a cruel, sensuous and revolting false god whose worship involved sexual degradation and lewdness. Ahab, king of Israel, married Jezebel and led the nation into Baal worship (1 Kings 16:31). Ahab and Jezebel’s reign over Israel is one of the saddest chapters in the history of God’s people.

There are two incidents in the life of Jezebel that characterize her and may define what is meant by the “Jezebel spirit.” One trait is her obsessive passion for domineering and controlling others, especially in the spiritual realm. When she became queen, she began a relentless campaign to rid Israel of all evidences of Yahweh worship. She ordered the extermination of all the prophets of the Lord (1 Kings 18:4, 13) and replaced their altars with those of Baal. Her strongest enemy was Elijah, who demanded a contest on Mount Carmel between the powers of Israel’s God and the powers of Jezebel and the priests of Baal (1 Kings 18). Of course, God won, but despite hearing of the miraculous powers of the Lord, Jezebel refused to repent and swore on her gods that she would pursue Elijah relentlessly and take his life. Her stubborn refusal to see and submit to the power of the living God would lead her to a hideous end (2 Kings 9:29–37).

The second incident involves a righteous man named Naboth who refused to sell to Ahab land adjoining the palace, rightly declaring that to sell his inheritance would be against the Lord’s command (1 Kings 21:3; Leviticus 25:23). While Ahab sulked and fumed on his bed, Jezebel taunted and ridiculed him for his weakness, then proceeded to have the innocent Naboth framed and stoned to death. Naboth’s sons were also stoned to death, so there would be no heirs, and the land would revert to the possession of the king. Such a single-minded determination to have one’s way, no matter who is destroyed in the process, is a characteristic of the Jezebel spirit.

So infamous was Jezebel’s sexual immorality and idol worship that the Lord Jesus Himself refers to her in a warning to the church at Thyatira (Revelation 2:18-29). Most likely referring to a woman in the church who influenced it the same way Jezebel influenced Israel into idolatry and sexual immorality, Jesus declares to the Thyatirans that she is not to be tolerated. Whoever this woman was, like Jezebel, she refused to repent of her immorality and her false teaching, and her fate was sealed. The Lord Jesus cast her onto a sick bed, along with those who committed idolatry with her. The end for those who succumb to a Jezebel spirit is always death and destruction, both in the physical and the spiritual sense.

Perhaps the best way to define the Jezebel spirit is to say it characterizes anyone who acts in the same manner as Jezebel did, engaging in immorality, idolatry, false teaching, and unrepentant sin. To go beyond that is to engage in conjecture and can possibly lead to false accusations and divisiveness within the body of Christ.",-0.9858,Negative,0.0225779967159277,Positive,0.2712934613227844,Neutral
"What does 1 Corinthians 6:9 mean? [⇑ See verse text ⇑]
Between here and verse 11, Paul makes it clear that how one lives reflects their relationship with Christ. At the same time, the gospel offers forgiveness and salvation to absolutely anyone willing to come to God in faith. Paul also makes a reference to sexual sins which modern interpreters sometimes attempt to ignore.

The idea of inheriting the kingdom of God or inheriting eternal life came out of the Jewish culture of the day. Jesus talked about it quite a bit (Luke 10:25; 18:18). The inheritance of a kingdom is not earned; it is passed on to the children of the king. Those who inherit God's kingdom are also receiving eternal life with Him in His glory forever.

Paul asks another ""do you not know"" question to remind the Corinthian Christians. This one reminds them of one group who will not inherit God's kingdom: the unrighteous—or the wicked, the wrongdoers. In Romans, Paul's clear teaching of the gospel is this: Only those who come to God through faith in Jesus are declared by God to be righteous (Romans 3:21–26). Only they will inherit God's kingdom.

Paul provides examples of those who are unrighteous, identifying them by the sins they embrace. Most of these practices would have been common in the Greek and Roman culture of the day. They include sexual immorality, meaning every kind of sex outside of heterosexual marriage, idol worship, adultery, meaning sex with another's spouse, and homosexual acts.

The words translated as ""practice homosexuality"" in the ESV include two Greek words: malakoi and arsenokoitai. Respectively, these indicate the passive and active participants in same-sex sexual behaviors. Translations such as the KJV, NASB, and NLT translate these as entirely separate expressions of sexual sin. Some recent re-interpretations claim these words refer only to homosexual prostitution or homosexual sex with children. Such a claim does not fit with consistent translation practices, the context of this passage, the universal interpretation of the passage for thousands of years, or with Paul's other teaching on the subject, such as Romans 1:26–27. In short, this is one of the New Testament's clear indications that homosexual actions—not temptations themselves, but behaviors—are deeply and unmistakably sinful. Embracing such behavior shows a deep rejection of God, just as much as would idolatry or cheating in business.

Paul will expand this list of Christ-denying actions in the following verse.

In verse 11, however, Paul will explain that those identifying labels are removed when a person comes to faith in Christ and is declared righteous by God. A person forgiven in Christ defines those sins as ""past tense."" They do not define who they are, or will be. Paul has made it clear that his target audience are born-again believers (1 Corinthians 1:2, 9). Some of them used to be known by these labels because of their sin. But that is not who they are any longer. Now, they are in Christ. As such, they must stop participating in any of these sins.
Context Summary
First Corinthians 6:1–11 details Paul's objections to Christians taking another to secular court over a minor issue. Believers will one day judge the world and angels. They should be able to judge small disputes amongst themselves. It would be better for a believer to be defrauded than to ask unbelievers to settle an argument between brothers in Christ. After all, unbelievers will not inherit God's kingdom. They are known by all the sins they do. Christians, though, have been cleansed from those sins and are now known only as belonging to Christ. This passage includes a passionate, powerful reminder that no person's sins are beyond Christ's power to forgive.


Chapter Summary
First Corinthians 6 continues Paul's confrontations of the Corinthian Christians over issues in the church. Earlier passages discussed problems of division into factions, and tolerance of heinous sexual sin. Paul is also outraged that they would take one another to court in a lawsuit over minor issues. Instead of suing each other before unbelievers, they should settle trivial issues in the church. Second, Paul urges them to live up to their new identities in Christ instead of living down to the sexually immoral standards of the culture. This sets up discussions of marriage in chapter 7.",-0.9848,Negative,0.0693492618492618,Positive,0.2527406513690948,Neutral

Shit, maybe I'ma keep you up, boy

"This is what I don't understand: So many people getting caught up about the sexuality of this song. It's nothing. It's fucking empty. Grande's a poseur like the rest of them. You want to... you want to up the game of promiscuity, or whatever? Saying ""fuck me"" in a song ain't gonna do it. Folk've been doing that before Grande was born. You wanna out-slut Madonna, to like, outdo her Sex book? Release a hardcore video on PornHub. Verified. Of you getting drilled by Johnny Sins. Until then, you're not shit. You're less than Miley Cyrus. Imagine being someone who transitions through multiple skin tones and been less than the girl who is the daughter of the guy who sang ""Achy Breaky Heart"".",0.6801,Positive,-0.0791666666666666,Negative,-0.8501061797142029,Negative
