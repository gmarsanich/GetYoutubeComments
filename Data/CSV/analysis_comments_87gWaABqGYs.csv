"She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

"""LYRIC""
Galway Girl
Ed Sheeran
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

in the english movie are often told the best accent is the british
while in german the best high german is in saxony anhalt and lower saxonie but also the the famest dialect is the low german

"She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

I may seem simple but that’s because everybody in New Jersey is mean and I kind of don’t listen to them but I am everybody’s bitch though. At least I try to properly spell and don’t talk to people as I kindly type because I am not rude. Everyone in New Jersey is completely mean and rude and pretends to hate everything when they copy and hate each other. No one copies me because I’m always annoyed then if I say at least I’m pretty they say I’m cocky which humbly most of the time I’m not. People are really ignorant of what the word cocky actually do means. And there’s slightly different versions of it.

"She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

"THE MOST IMPORTANT MESSAGE FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD💬💬💬  (This is gonna be long. You can skip it if you want, but the Lord is soon to come. He will bring judgment for everyone who sinned against Him. This is the message of hope.)  What is the most important thing in life?  Well, if God exists, then it must be to get to know who He is, and to know what will happen to you after you die. ☝️☝️☝️  So where would you go when you die? ☠️  The Bible says all of us have sinned against God. All of us have offended the holy and just God whose justice requires our lives! ""The soul that sins shall die — the penalty of sin is death.""  So if everyone sinned, then everyone will die! God promises eternal condemnation for all who sinned against Him.  We are sinners living in despair in this world. We're here to suffer the  world for a time and suffer the next world for eternity.  There are people who tell us doing good things will save us from God's judgment. No, not really. Romans 6:23 says that the wages of sin is ""death"", and not good works. We must pay our sins with our own lives!  ""Well, but doesn't God love us? ""  Exactly! The Bible tells us that because of God's unconditional love for us, He became a man 2000 years ago to die for all our sins. ❤️❤️❤️  The requirement of sin was the sinner's life, but Jesus gave His life as a substitute for ours.   We sinned, but Jesus died. That's called the grace of God! God took that which is ours (our punishment) for us to have that which is His (eternal life).   If you believe in Jesus, your punishment will become His, and His eternal life will become yours.   We broke God's law, Jesus paid the fine!   If you want to follow Christ today, then deny your whole self, and follow Him with all your heart! Pray and read the Bible daily and get to know who He is. Then start living for Him who died for you!   God bless you ❤️❤️❤️.",-0.9965,Negative,0.3049019607843137,Neutral,0.7571443319320679,Positive

"She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs do you want to drink on?

She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table, with Johnny riding as shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called, was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh, singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me, you know

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

My pretty little Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl

Now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night

I walked her home then she took me inside
Finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm going to put you in a song that I write
About a Galway girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand

"Origins of music unevidenced. Except it is gift to humanity from God the Creator. Music continues in heaven. Music discontinues in hell. 
Jesus Christ came from heaven to earth for one purpose only - to die on cross for remissions of pre-existing sins of every single person and to resurrect. Jesus Christ providing forgiveness from pre-existing sins for every single person, salvation from eternity in hell and free entry to eternity in heaven for all who repent of sins in Jesus Christ. 
Other side of death is eternity. Eternity in hell where there is no music but wailing and gnashing of teeth. Or eternity in heaven through Jesus Christ and enjoy heavenly music for free.

"※#%%#The Manchurian country was the breakwater which prevented aggression of the European and American Great Powers. Because this breakwater was torn, the Soviet Union invaded Manchurian and stole the Japanese northern territories The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Russia, China, North Korea become the Communist Party nation, and Korea carries out an anti-Japan activity, too. The rotation of Japan is full of enemy countries. Asian Communist Party prevented becoming it Manchurian country. When the United States thrusts Hull notebook and withdraws from Manchurian. Because it led to destroying a country to withdraw in Manchurian, Japan set war for self-defense and liberation in Asia. When it is a war crime. Russia, the United States, China still take Japan in the same pro-war inclination country in old days.

The equality was the concept that Mason thought about, and a phase contradicted freedom each other. If a company raises profit freely, there is it, and a rich person and poorman do not become equal. Freedom is restricted if I have the frames saying that I do it equally. The worker competes against a company for a right. Freedom and the equality are Operation double eagle of Mason. Of the quarrel that is fixed all the same not antagonism with the thing which Mason produced in both the liberalism nation and the communist state only play it. As for being hidden in the depths as for the commander-in-chief (Israel) of the evil in Revelation of Sun and Moon GOD. The world is instructed with structure braking under the pretense of two generals (Russia) quarrelling with one general (the United States) very much. In other words, Russia is together with the United States and rigs. Roosevelt ordered three Soviet Union from Stalin by a secret agreement of Yalta. The United States let money pay to Japan and, at the time of the Soviet Union collapse, saved the Soviet Union. Where is antagonism?
The Democratic Party copulates, too, and the LDP only rigs in the same way, too. Therefore I am under the patronage of Mason even if whichever wins. The American Republican and Democratic parties is the same, too. In other words, cards are marionettes of Mason. North Korea and the United States only perform a fixed quarrel when I understand this thing, and it is revealed that the United States lets you shoot a missile for Japan.

The human whom the United States drops an atom bomb and I burn you to death to a woman, a child, a baby and slaughtered is the greatest devil in history. I used it as a guinea pig and killed a Japanese 400,000. Why does the United States not apologize? The United States won against the Great War and got world hegemony. Because the American obtains the right, it is equally punishable. The United States gave a vivid description of the power of the atom bomb and threatened the Soviet Union in it and had a world right in my hand. It is wrong with unfairness to make economic sanctions because the United States of such devil lets North Korea abandon a nucleus.

The accident of Japan Airlines airplane 123 flights is a stratagem of the United States. By a threat to let Japan accept the Plaza Accord, the U.S. military plane shot it down and burnt the person who survived to death by a flame thrower. 520 victims were considered to be a sacrifice. The United States caused a bubble burst by a strong yen instruction and a share price manipulation, and Salomon Brothers sold it at a profit before the sudden fall of the stock and thereby plundered Japanese financial power of a nation. The discovery of the crash point was not late and was a delaying action of the evidence destruction. It is the collection of the piece of the missile and destruction work of the pressure bulkhead.

As for the Japanese slaughter case that I performed of Mason of the United States, there are emperor silver case, Nabari poison wine case, Fukuchiyama Line derailment, Chinese food plane crash, Wakayama poison curry case, the sarin subway attacks in Tokyo, the Matsumoto sarin incident, Kyoto animation arson terrorist incident besides. Because the Akihabara slasher case had a suspicious point in various ways, Tomohiro Kato of the criminal might receive a hypnotic suggestion, brainwashing.

In other words, Mason of the devil rules the world and schemes the world conquest using the United States. Because the greatest enemy is Japan, economy interferes it to destroy it thoroughly and is going to poison you using medical care, food. In Japan, a politician is assassinated if I go against an American policy to order, and the nation is slaughtered by a mysterious case not to know of the reason, too. Because Shoichi Nakagawa refused purchase of the US Treasury, I was assassinated.

An American, a Chinese, a Korean do the cruel brutality case.
[brutal person and ばむ cruelty] In tyushu case by the Chinese soldier, as for the man-eating group, the Korean, American Mason that exceeds far eat-like-a-dog manner group it drinks blood and the meat of the infant.
If rape it, and eight women are stabbed to death at the Asahi eaves, and people split lengthwise see mind;-resistant; did not pass. I looked at the person がの dead body like the proprietress at a close tower on the waterside entrance. As for the man, an eyeball is dug out; the upper body is hive . At the Japanese store close to the Nanjo gate, the dead body of the person like the master was left on the way, and a bone of the middle was exposed, and the internal organs were scattered.
There is the trace which almost all is fired, and the dead body of the Japanese boy left in a firm and the government office touches a rope, and took, and the blood sprays it on the wall, is for a language.
The video is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DW3zwolwtM&t=36s

A Japanese, awake. All the aims of the Chinese nuclear missile are sent to Japan. It is the United States that controls North Korea in the back and gives a Japanese abduction case, an order of the missile launch. These are parts of Japanese race extinction operation, and Japan is burnt to the ground by nuclear attack. The United States attacks it to Japan with the armed forces of the world. A Japanese deceived in the fraud of Japan-U.S. security treaty stupid.

Near future to read from Revelation of Sun and Moon GOD and illuminaty card, and to untie it in Japan
April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3. It is the last war with original God and the evil god. Japan is the country which original God protects in a land of the gods, and the evil god holds the Japanese people hostage and is made to have an experience cruel most because it is the stomach which is going to conquer original God.
x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021.
World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day
 Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023. Major earthquakes are generated in all parts of the world. 
An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023, and the earth becomes muddy sea 
The world (heaven) of the Maitreya is built on xx moon xx day in 2024

Final note
The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other I kill a cow pig, and to eat meat? I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. The human being takes the life of the lovely animal unconcernedly. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. It is the devil that it behaves like God in original God that the devil can see in the present world. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. Mason finally leads the world to the World War 3. It is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light.

"She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band

"She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

"Lyrics🎧

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs do you want to drink on?

She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table, with Johnny riding as shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called, was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh, singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me, you know

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

My pretty little Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl

Now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night

I walked her home then she took me inside
Finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm going to put you in a song that I write
