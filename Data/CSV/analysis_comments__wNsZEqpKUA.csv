"Thinking about this one time when I was in California (the same time Billie was in California for her concert) it was kinda late at night and me and my brother wanted to get chocolate covered bananas at this place cause we walked past it earlier, so in front of us was this girl and she was SO NICE like literally the second I heard her open her mouth I was like omg I love this stranger she sounds like the kindest human being ever I love her so much (yeah Ik that sounds so weird to think that about a stranger ikk) and she sounded familiar to me as well, she wore a mask which I took note of cause I hadn’t seen anyone the entire day let alone the entire week wear a mask in that town, especially outside (cuz the order thing was outside) and I was like oh that’s so sweet she’s wearing a mask 🥺 but now that I think about it, I literally Ik this sounds insane but I can’t stop wondering if that was Billie, she was in the area for her concert, she had the same exact hair style, (I think I didn’t rlly get a good look cuz I’m not just gonna stare at a stranger that’s creepy) she also had the same body figure, and the thing I noticed the most was her voice, I didn’t realize it until I saw Billie myself in Las Vegas a couple days later that her voice sounded soooo soothing and calm and just like ughh but it also didn’t sound like her regular voice and then she said she was sick and something was wrong with her throat and I felt so bad for her anywayyssss her voice sounded super similar to the girl, lmao Ik that’s crazy I really don’t think it was her but it’s fun to speculate and I wanted to write something",0.9706,Positive,0.0274749373433583,Positive,0.2328074425458908,Neutral
