👇👇👇👇👇👏
 People say I try too hard
People say I come off really awkward
You know I don't mean no harm
I'm just trying to be myself but

… Sometimes I get confused
'Cause I can't read social cues
Threw my inhibitions out the door
I don't have an excuse
I'm just living in my youth
Don't know why people don't like me more

… I have no friends but that's okay
I don't need them anyway
I do my best all on my own
And I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone

… I have no friends but I'll be fine
I don't need them to pass the time
And when I put my resting bitch face on I look stone cold
I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends

… I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone

… I have no friends but that's okay
I don't need them anyway
I do my best all on my own
And I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends

… You'll never know what's on my mind (my mind)
You'll never know the secrets that I'm keeping
I'll scare you off with my crazy eyes (my eyes)
'Cause all I need is me myself and

… I don't got no shame
'Cause my life is just a game
And I don't care who's been keeping score (oh, no)
Everybody thinks I'm strange
It's just something in my brain
Don't know who they're being normal for

… I have no friends but that's okay
I don't need them anyway
I do my best all on my own
And I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone

… I have no friends and that's a sign
I don't need them to pass the time
And when I put my resting bitch face on I look stone cold
I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends
No friends

… I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone

… I have no friends but that's okay
I don't need them anyway
I do my best all on my own
And I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends

… I don't need anybody's hand to hold at night
As long as I'm with me I know I'll be alright
'Cause I can't love no one else
Spent my love on just myself
Took this people-pleaser heart
And I tore it all apart
Now I'm finally set free
I'm so proud to be me
That's why I don't care I just wanna say
I have no

"No tengo amigos y no era con quien la gente simpatizaba...de hecho, siempre sentía un mural entre mí y el otro...

Pero entró a trabajar, y extrañamente les he agradado a todos y ese ambiente cálido me desconcierta. 

Tanta aceptación me pone muy contenta, pero me intriga cada muestra de cariño de mis compañer@s hacia mí...no estoy acostumbrada, eso no me pasaba a mí.

¿Cambie acaso? 

Es inevitable esa pregunta ¿He cambiado? 

Realmente antes no era así, y pase mucho tiempo preocupada por eso, el porqué no le agradaba a las personas, porque sentía un perpetuo rechazo. Y cuando supere eso, cuando ya no me importaba, cuando había aceptado mi situación y vivía sólo siendo yo, entró a un lugar donde son tan afectuosos conmigo... (normalmente la amabilidad se convertía en nada, y luego parecía que se olvidaban de mí

Se siente irreal. 

Me pregunto que hice para merecer tanta aceptación y aprecio. Igualmente estoy feliz.

Si lo cuento aquí es porque bueno...No tengo amigos ¿Recuerdan? Jaja en algún lado debo expresar mi desconcierto. XD",0.989,Positive,0.3019230769230769,Netural,0.3383127450942993,Positive

Threw my inhibitions out the door
I don't have an excuse
I'm just living in my youth
Don't know why people don't like me more
I have no friends but that's okay
I don't need them anyway
I do my best all on my own
And I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends but I'll be fine
I don't need them to pass the time
And when I put my resting bitch face on I look stone cold
I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends
I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends but that's okay
I don't need them anyway
I do my best all on my own
And I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends
You'll never know what's on my mind (my mind)
You'll never know the secrets that I'm keeping
I'll scare you off with my crazy eyes (my eyes)
'Cause all I need is me myself and
I don't got no shame
'Cause my life is just a game
And I don't care who's been keeping score (oh, no)
Everybody thinks I'm strange
It's just something in my brain
Don't know who they're being normal for
I have no friends but that's okay
I don't need them anyway
I do my best all on my own
And I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends and that's a sign
I don't need them to pass the time
And when I put my resting bitch face on I look stone cold
I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends
No friends
I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends but that's okay
I don't need them anyway
I do my best all on my own
And I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends
I don't need anybody's hand to hold at night
As long as I'm with me I know I'll be alright
'Cause I can't love no one else
Spent my love on just myself
Took this people-pleaser heart
And I tore it all apart
Now I'm finally set free
I'm so proud to be me
That's why I don't care I just wanna say
I have no
La la la la la
No friends
La la la la la

I'd just rather be alone

"When I was small my friends found lice on my head , and they told this to my other classmates then they started making fun of me and whenever I get close to them they start saying me that ""get lost from here u will share those lice to our head nd our moms will scold us""... Also I was too introvert (now also)...so I prefered to stay away from those girls of my class and used to sit at backbench (alone) 

And at that time, I was living at a small village... 

Then, For higher studies and for some reason I moved to Ahmedabad (it is a city of India)... 

So then I was very much happy because I 
was thinking that I will make new friends at new school and they will understand my condition... 😅😅... 

Nd in tht school(same condition) because I was very shy also bit weak at studies... Then, after 1year I came to grade 7th and in grade 7 I made a friend she also found lice on my head 😅.... 

Then I used to sit alone at front bench 
But In last of grade7th ,a girl named khushi became my friend 😊... 
She understood my condition and we used to talk very much... Nd then In class 8th khushi told this to her some friends and they become my friend... Now, Currently I'm in class 10th and made new friends, nd yeah I am so happy now ... 🤍

But, I will never ever forget that time... Nd this song also ☺🤍",0.9939,Positive,0.07793939393939395,Netural,0.45420753955841064,Positive

"I saw someone doing the parody of “let her go” so I decided to do one with this song 

RUN AWAY FROM HOME
My father thinks I’m not so smart
My mother sees me as a good for nothing
My brother stabbing me in the back
Forcing me to keep on pretending 

Screaming in my mind
Since I want no one to find
Drowning in my so lost thoughts

Walking down the stairs
As the spotlight till the end
This is not me ,was it worth it all

I feel my chest
Heaving pain
From what people say 
Bout me everyday 
My life is fab , that’s what they say
I just wanna be alone 
Never stay along

Keep up with the gossips
Till I’m my parent’s favourite
Always make them proud
But they never really say it
And the last thing I wanna hear is my brother’s mocking tone

So I  wanna be alone
Run away from home",-0.8346,Negative,0.09587301587301587,Netural,-0.39334627985954285,Negative

"People say I try too hard
People say I come off really awkward
You know I don't mean no harm
I'm just trying to be myself but
 
Sometimes I get confused
'Cause I can't read social cues
Threw my inhibitions out the door (out the door)
I don't have an excuse
I'm just living in my youth
Don't know why people don't like me more
 
I have no friends but that's okay
I don't need them anyway
I do my best, all on my own
And I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
 
I have no friends but I'll be fine
I don't need them to pass the time
And when I put my resting bitch face on I look stone cold
I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends
 
I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends, but that's okay
I don't need them anyway
I do my best all on my own
And I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends
 
You'll never know what's on my mind
You'll never know the secrets that I'm keeping
I'll scare you off with my crazy eyes
'Cause all I need is me myself and
 
I don't got no shame
'Cause my life is just a game
And I don't care who's been keeping score (Oh no)
Everybody thinks I'm strange
It's just something in my brain
Don't know who they're being normal for
 
I have no friends but that's okay
I don't need them anyway
I do my best all on my own
And I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
 
I have no friends (no friends) but I'll be fine
I don't need them (don't need them) to pass the time (ah)
And when I put my resting bitch face on I look stone cold
I'd just rather be alone (rather be alone)
Rather be alone (rather be alone)
I have no friends
(No friends) (uhhhhh uhh uh)
I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
 
I have no friends but that's okay
I don't need them anyway
I do my best all on my own
And I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
I have no friends
 
I don't need anybody's hand to hold at night
As long as I'm with me I know I'll be alright
'Cause I can't love no one else
Spent my love on just myself
Took this people-pleaser heart
And I tore it all apart
Now I'm finally set free
I'm so proud to be me
That's why I don't care I just wanna say
I have no...
La la la la la
No friends (Uhhh uhhh)
I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
 
I have no friends but that's okay
I don't need them anyway (I don't need them)
I do my best all on my own
And I'd just rather be alone
Rather be alone
 
I have no friends
(No friends)

At first it did bother me but I just eventually let it be, I don't care about other people's opinions about me, if I don't know you or care about you, I don't give a damn about your opinion.
And plus people can tell the rumors were false, cause what kind of degenerate that assaulted someone comes to school everyday like nothing happened?

"The girl in the very back, behind the boy, with red hair. She focused on schoolwork. She had one or two friends, but of course, neither actually cared about her. They just wanted homework answers. 

   The one with black hair, next to the window, the boy. He was gay, and he only had one friend, right next to him, but his friend didn’t know he was gay. If he did.. He’d be friendless.

   The blonde haired boy, in the back. He was the popular kid in class, but at what price? His family was failing, he didn’t have anyone who truly knew him, and he simply wanted.. Someone to know.

  The girl with red hair, and the red scarf. Her best friend died in a car crash, and she’s chosen to be mute since then. She never knew why she couldn’t just keep her best friend.

  The girl behind the red head, with black hair. Everyone would’ve known them as the quiet kid. Never made real friends. But truth is.. they were the only one with true friends. Sure, none of their friends lived close, but whenever they spoke, it was normal again.

   To the side, the one you only see the elbow of. That’s the class president. They had so many friends, but none trusted them. They had been used by their friends so often, yet didn’t let it bring them down. They always wore a smile on their face, trying to give hope to others.

   Finally, the boy with headphones in. He’d never had friends. But he wasn’t always a he, either. Once he was female, but now he was trans. Everyone thought he was a freak, changing his birth gender. So he never had a friend. But he knew everything about all of them.

  The boy with headphones, to the one in the back with black hair. “No one can change who you are, it’s fine to be different.”

   The class president, to the mute girl. “There’s always going to be a past pain, but only strong people can overcome it.”

  The girl focused on her schoolwork, to the girl with no friends living close. “We don’t have to be friends, but perhaps a study sesh?”

   The blonde to the boy with headphones. “Hey, nerd, wanna listen to music together some time?.. You have good taste.”

     


       No one will be alone forever. No one should give up after one heartbreak. No one should avoid others for just ‘schoolwork’. No one should focus on what others think. No one should fake a smile for others. And finally.. No one. Is alone. We’re all here together, on Earth. So the least we can do is help each other out.",0.935,Positive,0.10288525132275134,Netural,0.28747063875198364,Netural
