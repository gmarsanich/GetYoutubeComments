I like how she uses some of her much much older versions of herself from her most original songs in her original video clips. For example You Belong With Me Talyor was yelled at for being to happy while Oscar award Taylor wanted to run away because the felt like the only normal not so insane person in there lol. But it was also a very perfect representation of what someone's 20 different split personalities look like too.,0.9643,Positive,0.2878787878787879,Positive,0.7002930045127869,Positive
