"Jesus is not God. The reason is - Jesus was born. Jesus is not son of God. The reason is - Allah addressed Himself in Surah Ikhlas verses 1-4 of the Qur'an. Point 1 - God does not born. ( God created man and everything then what is the reason for God being born as His creation? How embarrassing is that?). Point 2 - God does not give birth of child. ( God mean creator then what is the reason for give birth of child. What a shameful reason isn't it?). Point 3 - God does not marry a girl. ( If God has created women beautifully, then what is the purpose of marrying a young girl as His creation? How fool isn't it?). Point 4 - God does not have father and mother. ( If God has father and mother then why God is creator? There is no need for a Creator if God has parents, because if God has parents as His creation, then what is the benefit to the Creator? ). Point 5 - God does not die. (So why are you called Idol is God and why are you calling Jesus God because humans have life but humans can die and idols are made by human hands - this means the end of human beings and any human being can break the idol at any time.The idol can't protect himself then what makes you call Idol is God. Calling Idol God and Jesus God, is not an insult to God). Whom Jesus believe, He is Allah, the one and only Lord. Allah has not beginning and no end but Allah is everliving and everlasting because He is most powerful and highest and greatest. Jesus is prophet of Allah and Jesus worship to Allah because Allah is our creator. His name is Isa, not Jesus. And ever is Allah exalted in might and wise. So you should believe in Allah because Allah is the only Lord and Lord of all.

"Stupid! Wrestling sucks lol 😂. I mean the storylines need more work. Roman Reigns beating Brock Lesnar is dumb! The best dumb one is Ronda Rousey losing Charlotte Flair. Ronda Rousey would be better destroying Flair. Rousey is a real life MMA fighter, and she needs to compete against the men’s division just like Chyna had done. She is too big for the woman’s division. WWE is the top wrestling, but their numbers are declining because it’s too much for kids. The attitude era was at its bests with the WWE.",-0.4738,Negative,0.0745535714285714,Neutral,-0.6371278166770935,Negative
The stone cold and Roman reigns fight didn’t end right I felt like it was too quick and there wasn’t enough Wrestlemania feel in it the rest of Wrestlemania was AMAZING though especially being able to see stone cold not once but TWICE!! 😄,0.8898,Positive,0.0226934523809523,Neutral,0.431612879037857,Positive
