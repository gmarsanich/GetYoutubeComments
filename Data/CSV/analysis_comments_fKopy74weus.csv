"Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things and
Wanna leave my own life behind
Not a ""Yes sir"", not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder
Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder, thunder
Thunder
Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
You say you're basic, you say you're easy
You're always riding in the back-seat
Now I'm smiling from the stage while
You were clapping in the nosebleeds
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, thun-thun-thunder

"Lyrics💞
Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things and
Wanna leave my own life behind
Not a ""Yes sir"", not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
You say you're basic, you say you're easy
You're always riding in the back-seat
Now I'm smiling from the stage while
You were clapping in the nosebleeds

THEIR first album was actually decent, had an indie alternative sound too it and i had high hopes for them but apparently whoever right there songs had a fucking brain aneurysm and everything after that sounds like it was written in 5 minutes while sitting on the toilet taking a shit. Pure corporate sell out absolute junk. I had to turn the volume down during this video just so I could give my opinion cuz I can't even handle 10 seconds of their music and if they ever come on the radio I Sprint over to it to turn that shit off.

"Way too many ""thunder"" repeats. Shows a point to the intentional purpose of the song's design, but I feel they should do a remake with less and publish that; problem being the 1.8 billion views so how many times each person has repeated this song would probably think it would destroy the song. Still think they should do it but remove about... 50% of the amount of times they say ""thunder"" repeatedly. It would make the song about 2 minutes long, so theres that, too.",-0.8519,Negative,0.1166666666666666,Positive,-0.539185643196106,Negative

"Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things and
Wanna leave my own life behind

Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
You say you're basic, you say you're easy
You're always riding in the back-seat
Now I'm smiling from the stage while
You were clapping in the nosebleeds
