Ever since the shields final chapter 2019 vince McMahon wont allow seth Rollins n Roman Roman Reigns to team up because Vince McMahon is being a lil kid holding a grudge against Jon moxley. So he'll let Rollins team with usos but not roman Reigns. Hell let Roman Reigns team with usos but not Seth Rollins. I remember 2018 when Roman Reigns was babyface talking to paul Heyman roman said my father taught me how to swim with sharks n ur just not worth saving. Idk man unless Seth joins the bloodline im not gonna watch the full 2 or 3 hrs.of ur show its not sports entertainment its not pro wrestling its annoying bro allow creative freedom back for all stables thatd the problem vince is taking to much control like the government.,0.8823,Positive,0.0142857142857142,Neutral,-0.437485784292221,Negative

But I really think that this run with Riddle, where he's legitimately just having the time of his life, is solidifying him as one of the all time greats. The man is just out there every week, being an incredible wrestler. He's damn good at what he does, and he's having so much fun right now that his energy is just infectious.

So electrifying.... nobody is more electrifying than Randy The Viper Orton and his RKO ""out of nowhere""! 20th Anniversary.. randy... and still having the best fun of his career and still so many years to become the real greatest of all time.

I do want Randy Orton be the very next Universal Champion of The World and WWE Heavyweight Champion... imagine how much that means for him... he so much deserves that... he does deserve something unique like that... he deserves all the gold in WWE, Randy Orton, the Legends Killer does deserves to be the next, the Greatest Legend in WWE ever!

Prove me wrong, folks.... prove me wrong or join me in my asking for that to Vince, you all, WWE Universe... Just give him all the gold, Vince, c'mon!!!
