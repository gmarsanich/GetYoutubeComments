"Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landside,
No escape from reality
Open your eyes,
Look up to the skies and see,
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
Because I'm easy come, easy go,
Little high, little low,
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to
Me, to me
Mamaaa,
Just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger,
Now he's dead
Mamaaa, life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, oooh,
Didn't mean to make you cry,
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all
The time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, oooh
I don't want to die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango!
Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo, Figaro - magnificoo
I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go)(Never) Never let you go
(Let me go) (Never) let you go (Let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me,
For meee
So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters,
Nothing really matters to me

"Is this theIs this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landside,
No escape from reality
Open your eyes,
Look up to the skies and see,
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
Because I'm easy come, easy go,
Little high, little low,
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to
Me, to me
Mamaaa,
Just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger,
Now he's dead
Mamaaa, life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, oooh,
Didn't mean to make you cry,
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all
The time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, oooh
I don't want to die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango!
Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo, Figaro - magnificoo
I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go

(Let me go) (Never) let you go (Let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me,
For meee
So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters,
Nothing really matters to me

"Ricetta lasagne: come si fanno pasta, ragù e besciamellaCome fare le lasagne (la pasta)

Le lasagne sono il formato di pasta più antico prodotto in Italia, di cui si trovano tracce già in epoca romana. Il termine lasagne,( anche lagana e lasagna) indica un particolare formato di pasta fresca di grano duro ricavato tagliando in grossi rettangoli la sfoglia di pasta madre. Le varianti delle lasagne più importanti sono due, la sfoglia all’uovo e l’altra di solo grano duro. La versione di solo grano duro è una specialità tipica del Mezzogiorno d’Italia che viene preparata senza uova e con uno spessore maggiore. Invece la sfoglia all’uovo è l’emblema della cucina emiliana, dove la pasta fresca (soprattutto all’uovo) ha una massiccia presenza.

Gli ingredienti per preparare le lasagne sono un tuorlo d’uovo ogni 100 g di farina e un pizzico di sale.

Per preparare le lasagne all’uovo, metti la farina”00″ sulla spianatoia formando una fontana e crea un cratere e polverizza tutt’intorno con un po’ di sale e sguscia al centro della farina le uova.Sbatti leggermente le uova con una forchetta solo quanto basta per mescolare tuorli con albumi; quindi inizia a incorporare un po’ di farina presa dai bordi del cratere.Continua a unire la farina alle uova, prendendola dalle pareti della fontana, poi comincia a intridere gli ingredienti con la punta delle dita, fin quando l’impasto  si presenterà un po’ granuloso. Continua a lavorare gli ingredienti con le dita fino a quando avrai raccolto tutta la farina e l’avrai incorporata alle uova.Quando l’impasto comincerà a prendere consistenza, lavoralo a piene mani: tiralo, per alcuni minuti, avanti e indietro con la parte bassa del palmo; staccalo dalla spianatoia aiutandoti con una spatola, raschia i residui di pasta che sono rimasti attaccati sul piano di lavoro e ricomincia a impastare sempre sulla sipanatoia ben infarinata.Dopo aver impastato almeno 10 minuti in modo energico o quando l’impasto comincerà a presentare delle bollicine, forma una palla, avvolgila nella pellicola per non esporla a correnti d’aria e lascia riposare l’impasto per almeno 30 minuti affinchè perda elasticità e si ammorbidisca un po’Prendi dall’impasto una parte e forma una pallina regolare, appiattiscila con le mani per conferirle la forma a disco. Quindi stendi l’impasto sulla spianatoia sempre ben infarinata con l’aiuto di un mattarello: parti sempre dal centro, facendolo scorrere in tutte le direzioni in modo da ottenere una sfoglia dallo spessore uniforme. Quando la sfoglia comicia ad allargarsi, per girarla avvolgila sul mattarello e ruotala di 90°. Continua a stendere la sfoglia fino a raggiungere lo spessore desiderato.",0.941,Positive,0.0014550264550264632,Netural,0.3764997124671936,Positive

Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger,
