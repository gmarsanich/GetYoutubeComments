"This is the actual winner for the video contest. This is the conception of Cursula.

There was a video that went hard hitting on the portion where it flickers and goes full deal like the most frightening thing I've ever seen. Just swarming with demons and regrets and painful faces. It also had a heavier overtone of being hanged. There was a ladder.

I love this though. I suppose this is the cleaned up version? It can be bloody if you use black blood.",-0.1761,Negative,-0.1208333333333333,Negative,0.315682053565979,Neutral

"What do you want from me? Why don’t you run from me?
私に何を求めてるの？なんで私から離れないの？
(ビリーのベッドの下にいる、” モンスター “の存在が語られ、コーラスはこのモンスターの視点から語られます。本人がこのモンスターは自分自身であり、自分の最悪の敵だとも語っています)

What are you wondering? What do you know?
何を考えてる？何を知ってるの？

Why aren’t you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
なんで私を恐れないの？なんで私を気にしたりするの？

When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
二人が眠りにつくとき、私たちはどこに行くの？

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Crooks]
Come here
こっちにきて
(もう一人の自分に語りかけます)

Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
言ってよ、吐き出すの、一体何なのよ

You’re payin’? Is the amount cleanin’ you out? Am I satisfactory?
責任取れるの？綺麗さっぱりいなくなる？私はそれで満足？

Today, I’m thinkin’ about the things that are deadly
今日は、消えかけてる物事のことを考えてたわ

The way I’m drinkin’ you down
あなたを飲み干すみたいに

Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me
私は溺れたいみたい、自分を終わらせてしまいたいように

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
グラスに歩み寄って、あなたの舌を満たすの

Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
友人を埋葬するの、そしてまた起こそうとするけど
(友人=自分自身に潜むモンスター・もしくは自分自身のこと。自分の中のモンスターを埋葬するというのは、彼女にとって自分の欲や弱さに打ち勝つことに繋がります。しかし、欲には勝てず、また起こそうとしてしまう葛藤が描かれます)

Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
共食いかしら、自分の相方を殺して
(モンスターのことでしょう)

Bury a friend, I wanna end me
友人を埋葬をするの、自分を終わらせたいのよ

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
自分を終わらせたいのよ

I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
もう終わらせたいの、自分をね

I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…
私は…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don’t you run from me?
私に何を求めてるの？なんで私から離れないの？

What are you wondering? What do you know?
何を考えてる？何を知ってるの？

Why aren’t you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
なんで私を恐れないの？なんで私を気にしたりするの？

When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
二人が眠りにつくとき、私たちはどこに行くの？

Listen
聞いて

Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
闇の中に閉じ込めていたけど、あなたは何を期待してたの？

Me to make you my art and make you a star
あなたをスターにしたり、私のアートを生み出したり

And get you connected?
それがあなたを結びつけていたの？
(アート的な側面で、モンスターは彼女自身と密接に結びついています。作品を作り出すのにモンスターの存在が欠かせなかったことが語られます)

I’ll meet you in the park, I’ll be calm and collected
公園で会うだろうから、その時は冷静で、自制心を持っているわ

But we knew right from the start that you’d fall apart
でも私たちは初めからわかってるの、あなたが離れて行くって

‘Cause I’m too expensive
だって私は高すぎるから

It’s probably somethin’ that shouldn’t be said out loud
大きな声でいうべき事じゃないかもしれないけど

Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
正直に言うわ、私は今頃死んでると思ってたの

Calling security, keepin’ my head held down
セキュリティに電話をかけて、私の頭はうなだれたまま

Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now
でももう、その友人とは仲直りしたか、埋葬したわ

[Bridge: Billie Eilish]
For the debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
私には借りがあるの、だからこの魂を売らないと

‘Cause I can’t say no, no, I can’t say no
だからノーとは言えないの、ノーなんて言えないわ

Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won’t close
その時、四肢が固まって、目が閉じなくなってしまった
(金縛りの状態です）

And I can’t say no, I can’t say no
それでノーと言えなくなったの、ノーとは言えなくなったのよ

Careful
気をつけて

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
グラスに歩み寄って、あなたの舌を満たすの

Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
友人を埋葬するの、そしてまた起こそうとするけど

Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
共食いかしら、相方を殺して

Bury a friend, I wanna end me
友人を埋葬をするの、自分を終わらせたいのよ

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
自分を終わらせたいのよ

I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
もう終わらせたいの、自分をね

I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…
私は…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don’t you run from me?
私に何を求めてるの？なんで私から離れないの？

What are you wondering? What do you know?
何を考えてる？何を知ってるの？

"Demonic music is an abomination to God. God, Jesus loves you all so much and wants you to turn away from anything evil that would distract you from Him. Time is short, Judgment on the world is approaching. Jesus Christ wants to have a relationship with you. Repentance of any and all sin (cheating, lying, adultery, sex outside of marriage, pornography, using the Lords name in vain...are all sin and must be repented of and turned away from). You may or may not believe in this, but Hell and Heaven are two REAL places. If you deny God and His goodness and turn to the ""evil one"" satan, you will find your place in Hell. you will experience Extreme torture much more intense then any torture here on earth, and for eternity (that means forever without stop).

"FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST, WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM SHALL NOT PERISH, BUT HAVE  EVERLASTING LIFE IN HEAVEN FOREVER AND EVER. John 3:16 Bible....THE RAINBOW🌈THRONE OF SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST AND THE TREE OF LIFE, Revelation 4 and Revelation 22 Bible. And whoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.🔥This is the second death. Revelations 20 bible.... ❤️I SAW A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. 2 Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 3 And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God. 4 And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.”
5 Then He who sat on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.” And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful.”❤️

"Lyrics
Billie...
What do you want from me?
Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering?
What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me?
Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
Come here...
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly?
You're payin'?
Is the amount cleanin' you out
Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about
The things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ahh-ha)
Cannibal class, killin' the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna–
What do you want from me?
Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering?
What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me?
Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
Listen...
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art
And make you a star and get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park
I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start
That you'd fall apart 'cause I'm too expensive
Your talk'll be somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Callin' security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury your friend right now
For the debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful...
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh-ha)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ahh-ha)
Cannibal class, killin' the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna–
What do you want from me?
Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering?
What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me?
Why do you care for me?

"This album is pure art. It is unexpected, creative, and unique. It is also refreshing to see a female in today's music industry who is not being ridiculously overt in her sexuality to sell the music (""Lost Cause"" excluded). The music is so amazing, it sells itself. Billie also seems to manage to be hypnotically alluring in her voice - while simultaneously being dressed in asexual, bulky, baggy, figure concealing clothing. The compositions are finely crafted and are quite complex in how they are textured. I can see the music visually in my head as a continuously morphing art piece, taking me to something new and different multiple times inside the song -- rather than being repetitively boring, predictable, and uninspiring like most mainstream music. Listening to Finneas explain how they designed their songs is fascinating too. I hope they pop out a new album every year together and that Billie & Finneas do not allow outside influences to change the magic they have going on in their duo. I hope they will mature in the way Lennon & McCartney did, with each year bringing a new and unexpected movement forward in music.",0.9496,Positive,0.1325712481962482,Positive,0.5733860731124878,Positive

"I bind and rebuke the hand of the enemy in the arts and entertainment industry. The devil is over arts and entertainment and songs and things like that so ain’t no surprise stuff like this is being produced.

Everything about this video is demonic and I call attention to it now in the name of Jesus . I call on the all mighty power of  God, and I bind all demonic activity and sorcery and witch craft, I tear it down in the name of Jesus. Holiness and righteousness Is coming to the arts and entertainment industry. I tear down all wickedness in high places, I command the music industry to come subject to the power of god. I shut down all demonic activity now in the name of Jesus, I shut it down now. All rulers of darkness in high places has to come down now. Every knee shall bow and tongue shall confess that Jesus is lord and has to come subject to the all powerful God. I call on the name of the lord Jesus and I come with swords of fire and buckets of blood. I command all demonic activity to cease now in the name of Jesus. The blood is against it. Every demonic song that comes from her lips will fall, it will fail and I bind it in the name of Jesus. God arise in every mountain of influence. Let the king of glory Come in. And this prayer shall go and achieve that it was sent to do, to shut down, tear down annihilate all demonic activity and tear down darkness in high places. And I dare the devil to come after me, I got some for em. If god be for me who can be against me and no weapon formed shall be able to prosper.  I send warring angels to fight and beat back the hand.

What do you want from me?
Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering?
What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me?
Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

Come here...

Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly?
You're payin'?
Is the amount cleanin' you out
Am I satisfactory?

Today, I'm thinkin' about
The things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ahh-ha)
Cannibal class, killin' the sus (Ahh)

Bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna–

What do you want from me?
Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering?
What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me?
Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

Listen...
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art
And make you a star and get you connected?

I'll meet you in the park
I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start
That you'd fall apart 'cause I'm too expensive

Your talk'll be somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Callin' security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury your friend right now

For the debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no

Careful...
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh-ha)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ahh-ha)
Cannibal class, killin' the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna–

What do you want from me?
Why don't you run from me?

"What do you want from me?
Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering?
What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me?
Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
Come here...
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly?
You're payin'?
Is the amount cleanin' you out
Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about
The things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ahh-ha)
Cannibal class, killin' the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna–
What do you want from me?
Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering?
What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me?
Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
Listen...
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art
And make you a star and get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park
I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start
That you'd fall apart 'cause I'm too expensive
Your talk'll be somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Callin' security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury your friend right now
For the debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful...
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh-ha)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ahh-ha)
Cannibal class, killin' the son (Ahh)
