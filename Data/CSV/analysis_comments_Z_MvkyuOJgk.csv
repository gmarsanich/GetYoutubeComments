"I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now

'Cause we're living life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans, and not give a damn
If we're missing out on what the people think is right
Seeing through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays

And then we'll go all night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothing when I'm in your eyes
Electrified, we'll keep turning up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone and loved
And all we need is us to go all
Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us

What do you reckon, is it just me?
Words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come when I feel the dark
And I open my heart
If you don't see it, you should trust me
I feel like I've got nothing left right now
Except this beauty in a dress right now
She got me feeling like the best, and the rest are just less
Than she needs, so we press play and step to the beat
'Cause we're living life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans, and not give a damn
Head out to the place where it plays

And we'll go all night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothing when I'm in your eyes
Electrified, we'll keep turning up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone and loved
And all we need is us to go all

"I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now
'Cause we're living life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans, and not give a damn
If we're missing out on what the people think is right
Seeing through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then we'll go all night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothing when I'm in your eyes
Electrified, we'll keep turning up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone and loved
And all we need is us to go all
Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us
What do you reckon, is it just me?
Words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come when I feel the dark
And I open my heart
If you don't see it, you should trust me
I feel like I've got nothing left right now
Except this beauty in a dress right now
She got me feeling like the best, and the rest are just less
Than she needs, so we press play and step to the beat
'Cause we're living life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans, and not give a damn
Head out to the place where it plays
And we'll go all night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothing when I'm in your eyes

Oh, we had dips and falls in our time

"Jesus is God & He loves you

Jesus will soon be seen by all men, women, and children in the clouds. Jesus is returning now! Believe and be saved.

Exodus 3:14 (God speaking)
And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.

John 8:58 (Jesus speaking)
Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.

John 10:30 (Jesus speaking)-
I and my Father are one.

Isaiah 9:6
For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, *The everlasting Father,* The Prince of Peace.

Matthew 1:23
Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, *God with us.*

John 1:1 & 14
1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
14 And the Word was made flesh (Lord Jesus), and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.

John 8:24 (Jesus speaking)-
I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.

John 14:9 (Jesus speaking)
Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father?

Hebrews 1:1-3, & 8 (God calls His Son ""O God"" because Jesus IS God in the flesh)
1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,
2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;
3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
8 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.

1 John 5:7
For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.

Titus 2:13
Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;

Revelation 1:7
Behold, he cometh with clouds; *and every eye shall see him,* and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.

Isaiah 44:6 (God speaking)
Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.

Revelation 1:8 (Jesus speaking)
I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, *the Almighty.*

Revelation 22:13 (Jesus speaking)
I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.

There Are None Righteous / How To Be Saved

Romans 3:10 & 23
10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

Luke 5:31-32 (Jesus speaking)
31 And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.
32 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

1 Peter 3:18 (The word “quicken” means “to make alive”)
For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:

Romans 10:9
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

Acts 4:12
Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

Ephesians 2:8-9
8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.

Repent of your sins or suffer the consequences. Lord Jesus died in our places personally to take the death punishment that sin deserves and then resurrected by the power of God. Believe this and sincerely repent of your sins each time you sin and you will have eternal life and nothing to fear. Fail to repent and you will end up in the Lake of Fire.",0.991,Positive,0.0870349206349206,Neutral,0.7099624276161194,Positive
