"You said you hated the ocean, but you're surfin' now
I said I'd love you for life, but I just sold our house
We were kids at the start, I guess we're grown-ups now, mm
Couldn't ever imagine even havin' doubts
But not everything works out, no
Now I'm out dancin' with strangers
You could be casually datin'
Damn, it's all changin' so fast

Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around and it knocked me down

Yeah, we were riding a wave, and trying not to drown
And on the surface, I held it together but underneath, I sorta came unwound
Where would I be? You're all that I need, my world, baby, you hold me down
You always hold me down, now
I've been a breaker and broken
Every mistake turns to moments
Wouldn't take anything back

It's been a hell of a year, thank God we made it out
Yeah, we were riding a wave, and trying not to drown
And on the surface, I held it together but underneath, I sorta came unwound
Where would I be? You're all that I need, my world, baby, you hold me down
You always hold me down, now
I've been a breaker and broken
Every mistake turns to moments
Wouldn't take anything back

"You said you hated the ocean, but you're surfin' now
I said I'd love you for life, but I just sold our house
We were kids at the start, I guess we're grown-ups now, mm
Couldn't ever imagine even havin' doubts
But not everything works out, no
Now I'm out dancin' with strangers
You could be casually datin'
Damn, it's all changin' so fast
Así es la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around and it knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
Así es la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life, baby
I was barely standin', but now I'm dancin'

Bidi-bam-bam-bam-bam
It's been a hell of a year, thank God we made it out
Yeah, we were riding a wave, and trying not to drown
And on the surface, I held it together but underneath, I sorta came unwound
Where would I be? You're all that I need, my world, baby, you hold me down
You always hold me down, now
I've been a breaker and broken
Every mistake turns to moments
Wouldn't take anything back
Así es la vida, sí (así e')
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around and it knocked me down
