🙃🙃   All Kane Brown's upcoming events and concerts will be cancelled due to his poor vocal.  Kane Brown can't even sing a Lullaby song.   He's an embarrassment to real country singers.  Everybody is leaving Kane Brown cuz he can't sing.  He can't even sing a lullaby song.  Kane Brown and Khalid they both can't sing squat.  Their voices are not marketable.  Their albums are not sellable.   Never on pitch and can't even carry a tune.  I wouldn't go to their concerts even if they pay me....people literally fall asleep during their concerts.    We're fed up with their mediocre performances at CMA awards.

"致一封具有法律正式效力及地位的通知信給TEDDY RADER先生：

以下，居住地於台灣，澎湖馬公市的李佳殷小姐控告你基於以下幾點事實。還請貴先生察驗一下，若無誤準備等候美國地方法院正式受理以一級謀殺罪的罪名起訴(含您在台灣所共謀的飛兒樂團、FAIRLAND IN REALITY吉他手黃漢青，目前已於澎湖地方警察局備案，關於您們共同違反跟蹤騷擾法乙事)及後續一切配合司法調查之情事通知。

1. 有鑑於貴先生您自一開始以網路駭客手法違法不當蒐集網路上以私人帳號留言給你之女網友之身分，並嘗試以駭入他人電腦、偷竊屬於他人個人私生活及隱私、含著作財產權等與個人相關之秘密資料，並且反向駭入對方手機及網際網路社群系統、包括但不限於YOUTUBE平台等，利用駭客帳號及身分雙向入侵民眾個人隱私生活之手法，意圖使人在不知情狀況下藉由閱讀、理解、以至於了解所發送之關於有意追求之曖昧訊息內容，使人後續足以在個人後續生活領域，藉由你遠端使用複合性關鍵字買廣告或新聞等手法以聽看聽之方式達到單方面致使其能於家產生自體性高潮之狀態，藉以達成並完成個人之洩慾目的，實屬已構成性妨礙罪。

2.在貴小姐網路上於2019年6月與其在教會所認識之弟兄，本名黃漢青先生，網路進展相戀、並論及婚嫁後、你以相同犯案手法更進一步自貴端網路系統不當利用及蒐集他方隱私性秘密資料，並以相同廣告關鍵字手法設計偷竊以其分身身分設計使李小姐誤以為該先生於網路不當傳送無關緊要與情色圖片內容，致使並誘發李小姐後續產生精神妄想情節，甚至產生後續生活謀生能力受損之身心相關疾病。

3. 在李小姐誤以為黃先生是魔鬼並與其單方面失聯後，你更蓄意進一步開始派遣人刻意於定時定點不是單向之人格特徵手法出現，刻意藉由營造自己身為公眾人物、後續藉由台灣眾知名藝人明星、含李小姐所居住地區之基督教會隸屬於好消息電視台為其代言效力、藉由公眾人物塑造具有可信度之形象，欲取信於李小姐，並後續使用自己Youtube官方平台做為單向溝通和聯絡之方法，
發布影音創作內容、製造相同有意追求及曖昧之相關內容，但使用貴李小姐對你之信任之溝通與訊息內容，完全利用在刻意設計並形塑對方的長期對人物之認知經驗，以利後續當設計之畢，對方後續單方面開展後續之生活時，每當遇到相關文字之訊息內容時，腦袋即會產生後續之嚴重之腦部性內在長期疾病性損傷以致於被營造甚至導致死亡、又或者漸進式失去長期生活自理能力。

4. 甚至於2021/12月中後期間，由於李小姐在其所秉持之基督信仰真理上與你產生爭執與辯論趁其不知情身上過往曾被你設計而產生之相關情事前，刻意聘用澎湖在地民眾、利用其不及認知理解甚至反應前的時間差，刻意蓄意安排一連串致使人無從對應及應變能力之時間，輔以加碼差派人刻意以打電話騷擾方式、一時之間讓李小姐產生類恐怖攻擊情節之現場環境及狀況，致使其誤以為遭受貴方攻擊、而產生無法克制之憤怒及情緒失控

5. 事後，李小姐產生後續嚴重失能及身心相關問題，期間陸續出現之症狀有含腦震盪、大量鼻腔流血、一時走路重心不穩摔跤，甚至肌肉無力等症後群。

以上，敬告貴先生所行已構成刑法上刻意謀殺之準定義，後續將提請法律訴訟。

Their albums are not sellable.   Never on pitch and can't even carry a tune.  I wouldn't go to their concerts even if they pay me....people literally fall asleep during their concerts.    We're fed up with their mediocre performances at CMA awards.  They should be permanently banned from the American music industry..,-0.8126,Negative,-0.1649999999999999,Negative,-0.9149746894836426,Negative
