My honest question to all of you is,  was that a right thing for him to do? 
You may not like t-series music videos because most of them are in indian languages and i request you to unsub it if you don't like it. But, is that a reason to target one particular channel and spread hatred. As an indian i feel very sad and offended.

while pewdiepie is taking support from many big youtubers and celebrities by tagging it (individual vs corporate war) but YouTube never call it as only for individual. *actually youtube is a platform where individual can ALSO setup their channel for free While corporate aren't denied to create channel.* the fact says it is one sided war.
