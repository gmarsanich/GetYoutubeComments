"Lyrics:-
Count up the bands sticking out
No rubber band is big enough
Chain is so heavy can't pick it up
Came with the gang, a myriad
I see your whip, hilarious
Fellas are broke, mysterious
My whip from Fast & Furious
Curtains with yellow interior

I get the commas period
Covered in ice, Siberia
I'm at the tip of the pyramid
Bitch I'm a star, I'm Serius
We came to play it's serious
Came with the gang, a myriad
Came with the gang, a myriad
Came with the motley crew

Sit up, ah, I just forgot where I was
Forgot I was
Pour it up, pour it up, pour it
Sit up whoa
Get up bitch get up bitch get up
Came with the wig splitter
I got John wick hitters
I'ma go get, get 'em
Wow!

Came with the army, army yea
The people round me still ain't shit
They just wanna party, party, party, yeah
We rowdy and will never chill

Count up the bands sticking out
No rubber band is big enough
Chain is so heavy can't pick it up
Came with the gang Ameri-ed
I see your whip, hilarious
Fellas are broke mysterious
My whip from Fast & Furious
Curtains with yellow interior

I get the commas period
Covered in ice, Siberia
I'm at the tip of the pyramid
Bitch I'm a star I'm serious
We came to play it's serious
Came with the gang a myriad
Came with the gang a myriad
Came with the motley crew

What you gon' do? I'ma pull up with the crew
When I'm off the juice
I got to hang out the roof
I'm rocking jewels
I like when the diamonds they move
I just go through, I do not wait in the cue

Baby, baby pinky Brady, Brady
AP Navy, Navy
Chain like 2 Mercedes
I come when they pay me
Come with Katy Amy
Crew go crazy, crazy
Kick em down daily

Came with the army, army yea
The people round me still ain't shit
They just wanna party, party, party, yeah
We rowdy and will never chill

Count up the bands sticking out
No rubber band is big enough
Chain is so heavy can't pick it up
Came with the gang Ameri-ed
I see your whip, hilarious
Fellas are broke mysterious
My whip from Fast & Furious
Curtains with yellow interior

I get the commas period
Covered in ice, Siberia
I'm at the tip of the pyramid
Bitch I'm a star I'm serious
We came to play it's serious
Came with the gang a myriad
