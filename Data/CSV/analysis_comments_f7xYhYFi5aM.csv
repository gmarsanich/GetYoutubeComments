"Here's how I would've ended this. Blake's mother(Katherine Norland) shows up to his school.

Mom: You're not as popular as you think, Boy!
Blake: Mom?! What are you doing here?!
(Frank, Lisa and Josh leave as Blake's mom walks forward to him)
Mom: I found out about your accident on TikTok while I was away on a business trip in New York. You are in so much trouble, young man!
Blake: Mom, I can explain everything......
Mom: Oh, you will all right. Just wait until your father gets home from the Maldives to hear this. You are officially grounded for the next three months. No cell phone, no  borrowing my Tesla, no TikTok or any other social media, no computer......
