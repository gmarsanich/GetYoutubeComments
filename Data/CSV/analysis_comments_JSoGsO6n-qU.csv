"Hey Gibi!
I just got the idea of another ""fastest medical exam"" but the patient (viewer) has some strange abilities:
When the doctor (You) is asking to close my eyes and answer if she is touching you with the hard or the soft side, the patient guesses it right before it can reach the patient's face.
How about that?",-0.1134,Negative,0.0906746031746031,Positive,0.3244700133800506,Neutral
