"I found a love for me
Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight",0.9991,Positive,0.4421130952380952,Positive,0.8487329483032227,Positive

I had been trying to find the perfect song for our “First Dance” and had narrowed it down to a couple, including one by Ed Sheeran, but hadn’t found one that was perfect.

"🎶🎶 LYRICS  🎶🎶

I found a love for me
Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect

I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight",0.9991,Positive,0.4421130952380952,Positive,0.7481203079223633,Positive

"Recently this song has hit different for me. Lately I've been kinda depressed, feeling like my life has no purpose the way I'm living it. I lost both my friends (not in death, but to bad addictions and life choices that they made that caused us to drift apart) and all I do is work and play video games. Then I went to my cousins engagement party and saw her brides maid. This girl, I've known her for some time, we're both the same age, our parents have known each other before we were born, and my mom even suggested her as someone I should ask out, which I blew off. But seeing this girl for the first time in years... it just sparked something in me.  No longer did my life feel as depressing. Suddenly I'm eager to accomplish goals that I've been putting off for to long and actually do something meaningful with my life. I then look up her social pages just to get more of an idea of what's she like nowadays and try to understand why I'm interested in her, and I'm surprised to find that she posses tons of the qualities I was hoping to find in a future partner. She's cute, has a nice personality (these two I already new), is spiritual, loves geeky stuff like Marvel and Star Wars, and shares some similar hobbies. She just feels...perfect. I wanna ask her out, but I strongly feel I should work on straightening out my life some more before attempting to start such a relationship.",0.9918,Positive,0.0811212121212121,Neutral,0.2688076198101043,Neutral

I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song

"""Perfect"" Lyrics

I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it,
Darling, you look perfect tonight

Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress
Looking so beautiful

Darling, you look perfect tonight

No, no, no

"I was with this girl for a bit more than 5 years. 
When we fell in love,  it was something that you only see in films, a love that only Elvis himself would sing about.
Things got so beautiful we thought it was indeed unreal, we were only kids when it all happened, but eventually we grew up together. I loved her since the day I saw her, 5 years later we are on our own separate way, but not because there was no more love between us, because people sometimes need to separate to understand how love works.
I learned so much from her, she fascinated me with every words she said. Love does help you grow up, it helps you understand why life is wonderful and so precious. I made a choice of loving her, then, now and forever. Love might be a feeling for some, but for me is more than that, is a commitment, something that you are proud of and something that you can always be happy about. I owe her all my happiness and all my beautiful memories.  I always wanted to see myself getting older next to her, but nobody can guarantee our next day. I guess happy-ever after is notfor everyone.
I'm not the guy to write stuff like this, but this song really makes me think of her and all our memories that we have together. I couldn't imagine a better love story than the one we had; Thanks Ed Sheeran for this song, and thanks to the love of my life for making me the man I am today. 
May God help you all find the one to make you better.",0.9988,Positive,0.4151960784313724,Positive,0.7980986833572388,Positive

I found a girl she was a love of my life back in 2005 in a little bar in Oklahoma she was a bartender a friend introduced me to her me being so shy I finally got the courage to ask her out she said yes we were only together for 3 months until Fusion needs to go back to her home state to take care of her dad but a few years later she come back by that time my mom was diagnosed with cancer she was dying how to take care of her 24 hours I didn't want to burden her with my problems so it actually when I saw her again like I didn't want to see her you look in her eyes when she drove away she was the love of my life and I let her go I'm writing this in hopes you might see this man can't forgive me it's been 16 years since that summer night we first met where is my little day that I don't think about her maybe this is just a lost cause she might not see this but I had to get it off my chest I still live at the same place I just wish you the happiness I would like to see her again love always Jason,0.985,Positive,0.0839646464646464,Neutral,0.3880631625652313,Positive

"I met a girl in my College. We became bestfriends!! And I had a crush on her!! From past few days we came too close and I don't know I was just in love with that feeling!! She called me her soulmate!! And me dumbfuck who doesn't even know that soulmate doesn't mean lover!! It means a person who helps you in every thing and stay with you in every worst situation!! I thought she loves me too!! We were sharing quotes to eachother I was writing liness for her!! Everything was so good until that day!!! I don't know what I was thinking that day I wrote it all!! Bruh I wrote every damn feeling.... And Damn she said - ""My heart is already broken I would never let anyone hurt it anymore!! I told you you're my soulmate just soulmate! And I think you can't be my soulmate now!!! I'm sorry!!..."" Yeah!! And now it's never the same as it was before!! I destroyed everything as I destroye everytime!! I became what I feared the most I became the same as every other guy!! I only wished that i could make her happy and I want to give every damn thing she deserves!! (ofcourse she deserves better than me, still..) And now I'm  just arguing with myself - whyyy!! Whyyy! Why would you tell her your feelings!! Why would you open up!! And sometimes I think - did I do something wrong?? Wouldn't it have been good if I never told her?? Where I have gone wrong!! Sometimes I just wish that this were just a nightmare that i could wake up from. Hey is this really true that every love is a loosing game??? I don't know what I'm supposed to do now!!! I'm just empty!! Looks like god does not have any plans for my relationship status!!
I feel like - ""I'm in a field of dandelions
Wishing on every one that you'll be mine!!
Anyways let it be!! Life goes on!!! Bro i can't tell you she is sooooo cuteeeee!! And I love her 🙂😩
In the end to the every person who is reading this heyy thanks alot there's noone whom I can tell this So thank you!! Don't have a good day have a great day!!!

honey I'll dive you right in 
and follow your lead 
well you found a girl 
beautiful and sweet oh 
you never knew i was the someone waiting for you 
yeah cause we were just kids when we fell in love 
without knowing what it was 
i know that you won’t give me up this time 
and honey I'll kiss you slow 
my heart is all you own 
and in my eyes i am holding yours 
honey we're dancing in the dark 
with you between our arms 
barefoot on the grass 
listening to our favourite song 
when i said i looked a mess 
you whispered underneath your breathe 
yeah i did heard it 
honey you also look perfect tonight 
well i found a man 
stronger than anyone i know 
i shares his dreams 
he says that someday he'll share me home 
we found a love 
to carry more than just our secrets 
to carry love 
to carry children of our own 
we are still kids but we're so in love 
fighting against all odds
cause we know we'll be alright this time 
and honey I'll hold your hands
I'm your girl cause you’re my man 
i also see our future in our eyes 
honey we're dancing in the dark 
with you between our arms 
barefoot on the grass 
listening to our favourite song 
when i saw you looking at me 
you looked so handsome 
yeah you  deserve me 
honey you also look perfect tonight 
honey we're dancing in the dark 
with you between our arms
