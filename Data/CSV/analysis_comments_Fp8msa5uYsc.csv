I recently lost my little brother we where extremely close all we had was each other I always took care of him I'm the oldest  and I'm very strong emotionally but it's tearing me apart inside every single day just wondering if there was anything I could have done to save him see he called me and messaged me begging for me to answer the phone  4 times that night at 3am but I was sleeping and didn't get those messages till the early morning when I woke up but it was too late he overdosed in a hotel room and im really having a hard time like really badly trying to accept that he is gone it's like I can't accept it I don't believe it for some reason but I really like this song it makes me think of him and all the good times we had together.  sorry for saying all that I just can't stop crying,0.9654,Positive,-0.046078869047619,Negative,0.3596974313259125,Positive

"In my household, Me and my mother lost many great cats. Most of them were kittens and one was the oldest son of the mother cat who was a rescue(I adopted her as a stray). I miss all of them terribly. I especially miss the mother and her son because I helped the mommy cat give birth to her 5 healthy kittens many months ago.

The death of the mother, followed by 4 of my other cat's kitten and lastly the oldest son of the mother, greatly affected me and my mother. Today I'm still taking good care with 5 of the cats and they're perfectly healthy.

In my neighbourhood, everyone doesnt really care about the wellbeing of every pet. They mostly focused on the breeds and I hated it so much. The last death of my cat taught me a lesson that not everyone is gonna be there to grieve with you. Some would poke fun at you and some would ignore your pain. Its also the sad reality of losing someone..",-0.9106,Negative,0.2486111111111111,Positive,0.3634561896324157,Positive

"My parents both passed when I was 9 within nine months of one another. 30 years later I passed their ages at death. I cry everyday. Why do I get to live longer then them and enjoy my 2 girls. I used to feel bad for myself. Now I feel bad for them. The real thing that people don’t tell you about losing a loved one is, the pain never goes away. Time slowly dulls it but really when they both died, I died. I could tell you that my daughters complete me and make me whole but I’d be lying to you. I haven’t gotten the wisdom yet to live life and enjoy those around me rather I’m just a master directing a shell to attempt to function and do the right things-my advice try not to dwell go out there and live.

"Laps Around The Sun

Nobody Thought We'd Make It
That Scary Day In 87' 20 October
Then 72hrs Later, With Some Praying
The Pain Was Over...
See Life's Not ""Easy""
However, I'm Still A ""Breather""
Against All Odds I Am My Mother's Keeper
You Were With Me From The Start
I Was With You Until The End
We'll Always Be Together In Spirit
More Than A Parent, My Solidified Friend
Life's Challenges Never Broke Us
Although Some Did Cause Us To Bend
Most Days Were Better Than Others
When They Weren't, We Still Kept The Faith
We Wouldn't Have Gotten So Far
If It Weren't For His Grace
This Is A Borrowed Life
Where We Are All On The Clock
You Were Truly One Of A Kind
The Cream Of The Crop
My Thanks Is Extended For Eternity
I'll Forever Be In Your Debt
Memories Are Everlasting
Those I'll Cherish & Never Forget 
Your Belief In Me Is Unmatched
The Love Given, Can't Be Replaced
I've Lost A Mother, But Gained An Angel
Spread Your Wings, I'll Continue To Run My Race
Words Don't Describe The Bond That We Shared
I've Come To Realize, Sometimes Life Isn't Fair
His First True Love & Her Last...Your One & Only Son
I Wish We Could Have Had More Laps Around The Sun
