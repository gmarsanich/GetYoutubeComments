They are all connected to each other, and they believe that they have a much better chance of gaining eternal life for themselves and corrupting humanity than to lose.Therefore, those new people whom they accept into their community agree to be with them not only because if they refuse and they will be killed, but also because he sees that they have a better chance of winning.They are behind the world wars , they created and spread the coronavirus , now their goal is to create a single unified world and a single world government. All spiritual life will be concentrated within one church,they need it to ensure the arrival of the Antichrist (Dajjal) and prevent the second coming of Jesus and the last judgment ,thereby ensuring the end of history beneficial to Lucifer and insignificant for humanity ,such conditions are allowed by God ,when Lucifer (Iblis) disobeyed God and did not bow to Adam , God could have killed him, but Lucifer (Iblis) asked to leave his life, and for this he will experience the creation of God - man in particular and humanity in general, Lucifer(iblis) (he can not, like any demon ( jin), communicate directly with a person, but through the rites of magic there can be a connection) . For humanity there are 3 variants of the outcome , the first arrival of the Antichrist and such a fall of the spirit that it will not be awarded 2 the coming of Jesus and then the last judgment will not be and all will be erased into dust , except for approximately 190,000 people who helped the devil to defeat humanity ,and Lucifer and those will receive eternal life .to whom he distributed his marks, signs, about 190,000 people (the antichrist, aka dajjal, can command matter and resurrect the dead with the condition that they will not go to heaven), who helped the devil defeat humanity, according to their plans there will be a new Atlantis on earth (a new golden age of humanity) where they will already live foreverand the second variant of the Human spirit on the scale of the planet will be so strong that they will not be able to bring the Antichrist , but will immediately be 2 the coming of Jesus and then there will be a last judgment , and the devil and his servants , it is clear what will happen to them . Well, the last option they will achieve the coming of the Antichrist , but humanity in general will fight for itself and God will let down Jesus and we will win and there will be a last judgment .They are fighting for eternal life for themselves, and for us they want to leave the option that we will all be wiped out and not even bother with the last judgment . The outcome depends on each of you , and your life after death .This information is for you , why in fact the \"world elite\" and more precisely the satanic elite, or even more precisely the committee for the meeting of the antichrist, is engaged in all this .And our task is to stop them . And let me remind you that the world is being developed by industrialists , scientists , farmers, teachers.
