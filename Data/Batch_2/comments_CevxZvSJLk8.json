It's been an honor.  Your an amazing woman.  I already know where I'm going to store your ring once I can afford to buy it.  The choice is yours.  If it's 1 it's monogamous until the end.  If it's 2 it's monogamous celebacy until the end.  If it's 3 I'm the entire Universe dressed as a pretty well maintained vagrant until the end.  A full natural life that's the rule then we can choose before Him.  I'll give you 2 years from this date to decide because He wants me physically retired in a Man suit not the Ghost that if tonight was the end I would be.  There's alot of vengeance with that Ghost.
