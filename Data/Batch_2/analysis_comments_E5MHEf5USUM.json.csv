"scares were pretty cool in the beginning, but got underwhelming fast just because of how upfront they were.  the end straight up sucked imo, as it started rambling on like a typical Conjuring movie.  You know, ""scary demon voices"" ""oooooh satan I am demon oooooh""
That kind of thing removes any suspense by almost immediately telling you what kind of threat you're against--- a threat that in its core really isn't that scary because all it's going to do the entire time is ""Boo! Ghost!"" you and have some undelivered threat of stealing your soul ... or something.


this has potential only partially realized and I hope whatever comes next realizes its full potential.

Honestly I would have loved to see this game take a direction of something more in the line of Autopsy of Jane Doe; in which even when the scares get obvious, there's still an omnipresent unknown that feels threatening.",-0.9527,Negative,0.12101449275362318,Netural,0.43579626083374023,Positive
